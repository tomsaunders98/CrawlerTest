  <div class="title"> Matters of the Mind <span class="subtitle">How Covid-19 has accelerated a mental health crisis across UK universities.</span>
    <span class="byline">By Thomas Saunders</span>

      <p>Inevitably, as soon as Exeter University opened its doors to students this year coronavirus cases began to spiral upwards on its campus. The cases in halls of residence, which mainly house first-year undergraduate students, reached around
        <span class="red">140 a day</span> before the scholastic term had even started.
      </p>

      <p>In response, Exeter, and universities across the country, locked down campuses to stop the virus spreading into the local community. In most cases, this was a resounding success. In Exeter, the huge increase in virus cases was not seen <span
          style="color:#B58EAD;">outside the university</span>.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="desc">
    <div class="nestdesc">
      <p>However, the tough measures that universities put in place have taken a toll on students’ wellbeing, adding to a burgeoning mental health crisis already well underway before the pandemic.</p><p> For first-year students living in halls, the situation was particularly dire.   </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="desc">
    <div class="nestdesc">
      <p>UK-wide lockdown rules have, at times, seemed arbitrary, although broadly comprehensible. However, in student halls at Edinburgh, byzantine lockdown rules forbade students from walking the wrong way down their corridors or using the toilet at the same time as other students.   </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="desc">
    <div class="nestdesc">
      <p>In some universities first-year students were grouped into households by floor, meaning that up to 30 people could occupy one ‘household’. Whenever one student in a household contracted the virus everyone had to isolate, resulting in students self-isolating several times over, often going weeks on end without any social interaction. </p>
      <p>This has had such a severe effect on students that a report from Public Health Scotland mentioned that “the fear of repeat self-isolation for some students was such that they mentioned self-harm” in interviews.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="desc">
    <div class="nestdesc">
      <p>One first-year student at Edinburgh said: “I was met by confusing and contradictory rules and poor communication from the university. Add in the hostile environment created by aggressive security and threats of fines for minor offences and, instead of being enjoyable, I found the situation very stressful.” </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="desc">
    <div class="nestdesc">
      <p>At the same time, student support systems continue to be woefully underequipped to deal with the rise in demand for their services. Even before the pandemic, the average waiting time for counselling services could reach up to three months, according to a survey from Randstad. </p><p>Often students wanting mental health support have little choice but to seek help privately, if they can afford it.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="desc">
    <div class="nestdesc">
      <p>One student, currently in his second year at St Andrews, said: “Had I not chosen to see a counsellor privately I easily could have slipped through the cracks.”
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="desc">
    <div class="nestdesc">
      <p>Universities across the country have struggled to cope with the crisis, as falling revenues along with COIVD-19 restrictions have made it harder to maintain the same level of services they offered before the pandemic.</p><p> The government has stepped in and provided £3 million to fund Student Space, an online platform for students to access wellbeing resources, in addition to £9 million in extra funding to mental health charities.

    <div class="nestdesc">
      <p>However, it remains to be seen this alone will be enough to support students through what will likely be a similarly taxing second term.
</p><p>Edinburgh University and St Andrews University did not respond to a request for comment.
