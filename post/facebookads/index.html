<p>Using Facebook’s Ad Library API, I’ve taken a look about what Facebook ads can tell us about the final month of the Republican and Democrat Campaigns.</p>
<div id="what-can-facebook-ad-spending-tell-us-about-the-election" class="section level2">
<h2>What can Facebook Ad Spending tell us about the Election?</h2>
<p>With the election less than day away, It’s still not particularly clear how each party have forecasted their own chances of winning the election. Naturally, towards the press both parties have been publicly bullish of their chances of winning 270 electoral votes.</p>
<p>However, where both parties can’t lie is in there election advertising. Naturally, both parties have tried to maximise each dollar spent on adverts and since all election spending on Facebook is publicly available we can use this data to make some interesting observations.</p>
<div id="who-is-spending-where" class="section level3">
<h3>Who is spending where ?</h3>
<p>Both parties have separate funding entities for their presidential campaigns and their party campaigns (run by each party’s national committee). The difference in Ad spending between the presidential and party campaigns can tell us a lot about where the GOP and Democrats think they can win and where they have began to give up.</p>
<div id="rnc-v.-trump-campaign" class="section level4">
<h4>RNC v. Trump Campaign</h4>
<p><img src="/post/FacebookAds_files/figure-html/GOPvGOP-1.png" width="1152" /></p>
<p>Most of this is fairly unremarkable. Its understandable that the RNC has spent far more in Arizona, where their senator Kirsten Sinema is in a very heated election race. It’s also not particularly surprising that Trump’s campaign has focused in on Wisconsin whilst the RNC has looked elsewhere since there are no important state races in Wisconsin this year.</p>
<p>This logic represents most of the discrepancies in this bar chart. However, a striking exception is Maine. The GOP senator Susan Collins is up for reelection in Maine this year and yet RNC spending on the race is barely higher than Trump’s campaign and is nowhere near the proportion the RNC has spent on other Senate races such as the ones in North Carolina and Arizona.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="dnc-v.-biden-campaign" class="section level3">
<h3>DNC v. Biden Campaign</h3>
<p><img src="/post/FacebookAds_files/figure-html/DemvDem-1.png" width="1152" /></p>
<p>Advertising spending by Democrats tells a largely similar story to that of the GOP. It is interesting that in Texas the spending from Biden’s campaign has far outpaced that of the party even though Republican senator John Cornyn is up for reelection. Polling averages for Cornyn put him up around 7 points ahead of his Democrat challenger, MJ Hegar. This could be the reason for the reduced emphasis on the race, its unlikely that Democrats can win state-wide in Texas and its likely the DNC has decided to focus its resources elsewhere.</p>
</div>
<div id="are-biden-and-trump-targetting-the-same-states" class="section level3">
<h3>Are Biden and Trump targetting the same states?</h3>
<p><img src="/post/FacebookAds_files/figure-html/BidenvTrump-1.png" width="1152" /></p>
<p>This seems to fit the wider narrative of this election. The Trump campaign have focused spending in key swing states in which they are behind such as Pennyslvania and Michigan. In all of these rust belt states the Trump campaign have spent a greater proportion of their ad budget than the Biden campaign, sometimes almost double.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Biden’s resources have been spread far more widely with generous resources also give to states such as Iowa, Texas and North Carolina.</p>
</div>
<div id="are-the-rnc-and-dnc-targetting-the-same-states" class="section level3">
<h3>Are the RNC and DNC targetting the same states?</h3>
<p><img src="/post/FacebookAds_files/figure-html/RNCvDNC-1.png" width="1152" /></p>
<p>There are some huge discrepancies between the RNC and DNC in spending. Most notably in Ohio, where the DNC has spent a far higher proportion of its budget whilst the RNC has spent almost nothing. Its curious as to why the DNC has focused so much on Ohio as there are no Senate elections this year.</p>
</div>
<div id="bang-for-buck" class="section level3">
<h3>Bang for Buck</h3>
<p><strong>1. On average, the GOP spent received around 27 views per $ spent on their adverts whilst the Democrats recieved around 40 views per $ spent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. On average the GOP received 1300 views per ad and the Democrats received around 3000 views per advert.</strong></p>
<p>This could be due to any number of reasons and Facebook does not provide enough information on adverts for us to determine why this. Most probably, the GOP are prioritising clicks rather than views and you will spend more if you focus more on clicks rather than simply views.</p>
