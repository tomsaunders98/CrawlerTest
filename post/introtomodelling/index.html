<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Much like weather forecasting is the practice of using current and past meteorological data to predict future weather patterns, election forecasting is the practice of using past and present election data to predict future vote outcomes.</p>
<p>Over the last 12 years election forecasts have moved from being the sole interest of political scientists and statisticians to become a key part of many newspapers’ electoral coverage. However, whilst now many newspapers such as <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/race-forecasts-and-predictions/">Politico</a>, <a href="https://ig.ft.com/us-election-2020/">The Financial Times</a> and <a href="https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president">The Economist</a>, amongst others, provide detailed election forecasts there has been little said about the mechanics behind them.</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks I have been trying to build my own election forecast and in the process I have learnt a great deal about the theory that informs election models, which I am sharing here in a preliminary post. My plan is to make this into a series as I learn more about election forecasting and develop my own model further.</p>
</div>
<div id="fundamentalstructural-models" class="section level2">
<h2>Fundamental/Structural Models</h2>
<p>Election modelling can broadly be separated into two distinct disciplines, the first of which are those that design models based on “fundamentals”.i These models are both the oldest type of election forecast and, in theory, the holy grail of election forecasting in the opinion of many political scientists. These models rest on the assumption that there is a profound and observable relationship between economic and political indicators such as GDP, disposable income or presidential approval ratings and voting intentions.</p>
<p>As a statement of fact, this would seem self-evident. It’s obvious to anyone that there is some relationship between the health of an economy and voting patterns and in academic circles this belief has been established for some <a href="https://fairmodel.econ.yale.edu/rayfair/pdf/1978B200.PDF">time</a>.</p>
<p>However, the challenge of structural modelling lies not in knowing the relationship between “fundamentals” and election outcomes exists but in quantifying it. From a statistical point of view, this challenge is more or less impossible. Elections are incredibly rare events and even all the election information from 1940 onwards (only 20 separate data points) provides us with nowhere near enough data to extrapolate from or to analyse which “fundamentals” are the most important.</p>
<p>Case in point, the “<a href="https://pollyvote.com/en/components/models/retrospective/fundamentals-plus-models/time-for-change-model/">Time for Change</a>” Model by Alan Abramowitz, much feted for correctly predicting the popular vote winner for every election from 1992 to 2008.ii The model uses only three fundamentals, one of which is GDP growth for the second quarter. Whilst this model has performed admirably in the past, it currently predicts that Trump will lose the popular vote in 2020 by 36 points, an absurd estimate.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the “<a href="https://douglas-hibbs.com/HibbsArticles/HIBBS-PS-2012-ONLINE.pdf">Bread and Peace</a>” model , which uses real disposable income as an indicator, would likely have Trump winning as disposable income has continued to rise. Ultimately, these models are excellent at fitting past election data, but entirely hopeless at accurately and consistently predicting future elections.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Vote_{t} = \alpha + \beta_{1}\left( \sum_{j=0}^{14} \lambda^j \Delta ln R_{t-j}*\left( \frac{1}{\sum_{j=0}^{14}\lambda^j}   \right) \right) + \beta_{2} Fatalities_{t} \]</span></p>

</table>
<p>It’s clear that structural models just don’t work and that over such a small dataset all manner of combinations of indicators are likely to throw up an incidental correlation that has no actual basis in reality. This leaves with the other type of election model: poll-based models.</p>
</div>
<div id="poll-based-model" class="section level2">
<h2>Poll-Based Model</h2>
<p>Polls themselves are clearly not perfect predictors on an individual basis and this is mainly due to two methodological problems. Firstly, polls are the victim of some factor of bias. This bias can be regulated to a particular pollster company since each polling house uses different interview styles, weighting schemes which can invite error. However, bias can also exist across all pollsters such as in the 2016 election when Trump voters were less likely to answer polling companies’ phone calls. This lead to a “non-response bias” in which pollsters undercounted Trump’s support in key states, namely Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Secondly, the sample size of publicly released polls are often too small to predict small but potentially important changes in voter attitudes. Almost all polls come with a margin of error that is represented as a 95% confidence interval that can be illustrated as such:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \hat{\alpha} \pm 1.96\sqrt{\frac{\hat{\alpha}(1-\hat{\alpha})}{n} }\]</span>
Since the precision of a poll increases in the square root of the sample size, this means that a pollster obtains increasingly diminishing gains in accuracy for a corresponding increase in sample size. On the other hand, the fixed costs of expanding the size of a poll remain more or less constant. This dissuades pollsters from conducting polls with samples of anything more than 1000-1500 participants. However, <a href="https://www.uh.edu/hobby/eitm/_docs/past-lectures/2015-Lectures/Harold-Clarke/Pooling-the-Polls-Over-an-Election-Campaign.pdf">statistical caluclations</a> show that a sample size of at least 65,000 is needed to give a pollster a 95% chance of detecting a 1% change in the polls. Simply taking the mean of all the polls available in a given week may help mitigate this effect but it will do little to mitigate bias.</p>
</div>
<div id="bayesian-modelling" class="section level2">
<h2>Bayesian Modelling</h2>
<p>In order to build a model that can both accurately compensate for sample sizes as well polling bias, also know as the “house effect”, we must turn to Bayesian Inference.
Bayesian inference is a form of statistical inference which tells us how to update our own beliefs based on new data. Bayes’ Theorem, when applied to probability distributions, is as followsiii:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(\theta | data) \propto f(data | \theta ) * f(\theta)\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(f(\theta)\)</span> is a prior belief, <span class="math inline">\(f(data | \theta )\)</span> represents the distribution of the data give the prior, known as the likelihood, and <span class="math inline">\(f(\theta | data)\)</span> represents the probability distribution of our prior given new data, also known as the posterior. Therefore, the posterior is proportional to the likelihood times the prior.</p>
</div>
<div id="dynamic-linear-models" class="section level2">
<h2>Dynamic Linear Models</h2>
<p>This is the cornerstone upon which a specific type of Bayesian model, a Dynamic Linear Model, is built. A Dynamic Linear Model is appropriate for election modelling as it is designed to measure a latent quantity that evolves over time and of which there are only imprecise measurements. In the case of Election models, this latent quantity is the actual vote share of each party and the imprecise measurements are the polls.</p>
<p>In its simplest form a DLM can be described be a set of core equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P_{i} = \mu_{i} + \sigma^2_{i}, \sigma^2 \sim N(0,\sigma^2_{i} ).....(1)\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[ \mu_{i} = \mu_{i-1} + \delta_{i}, \delta \sim N(0,\sigma^2_{i} ).....(2)\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[ \mu_{0} = N(m_{0},C_{0} ) .....(3)\]</span>
Equation (1) defines an actual Poll (<span class="math inline">\(P_{i}\)</span>) I, as the sum of the estimated latent trend (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_{i}\)</span>) plus some variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_{i}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Correspondingly, Equation (2) states that the latent trend at some time t equals the previous latent trend (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_{i-1}\)</span>) plus some variance <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{i}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Equation (3) states that the latent state at the start (when <span class="math inline">\(i=0\)</span>) of this time trend is defined as a Normal distribution with expectation <span class="math inline">\(m_{0}\)</span> and variance <span class="math inline">\(c_{0}\)</span>, which represents are initial prior.</p>
<p>The process of a DLM works by continuously trying to predict the next stage in the time series and when new data comes in (a new poll) we calculate how far off we are and update our expectation of the true latent state.</p>
</div>
<div id="my-model" class="section level2">
<h2>My Model</h2>
<p>I have implemented an extremely basic version of this DLM in R using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bsts/bsts.pdf">Bayesian Structural Time Series Package</a> and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. 4000 simulations were completed for each party with the first 100 being discarded as ‘burn-in’. At the outset no prior was consciously specified apart from the sigma term in equation (1) which was given an inverse gamma prior. The code is available on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/tomsaunders98/2020ElectionModel">here</a>.</p>
<p>Using this model we can still demonstrate that on the final day of polling the model stated that there was approximately a 64% chance that Obama would win the popular vote:</p>

<h3>Normal distribution of final trend:</h3>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomsaunders98/2020ElectionModel/master/Prob2008Model.png" /></p>
<p>In the diagram below the performance of the model on the vote share of the 2008 presidential election is illustrated over time. Each dot represent polls taken over the period preceding the election and the solid line illustrates the mean of the posterior distribution.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomsaunders98/2020ElectionModel/master/2008dlm.png" /></p>
<p>Overall, the model performs adequately well, although it is more of a theoretical exercise to develop my own understanding of DLMs rather than a serious attempt at modelling the election. My idea is that this post will be the first in a series as I learn more about Bayesian inference and DLMs and develop more complex models that properly take into account house effects and samples sizes.</p>
