<p>I’m a bit late to the discussion on Per Capita Graphs and their relation to Covid-19 deaths. Nevertheless, it’s been on my mind a while and I wanted to lay out my thoughts on the issue.</p>
<div id="logarithmic-graphs-and-covid" class="section level2">
<h2>1. Logarithmic Graphs and Covid</h2>
Coivd-19 spreads exponentially, as such it makes sense to chart the graph using logs. Let’s take a very simple example, assuming that the <strong>R</strong> of Covid-19 is 2. This means for every 1 person who has the virus they will infect 2 people. If we assume that everyone infects their 2 people in a single say we can represent this matheticaly:
<center>
<span class="math inline">\(N = 2^t\)</span>
</center>
<p>Where <em>N</em> is the number of people affected and <em>t</em> is the number of days since the first infection. Of course, in real life the R varies constantly and no Covid-19 death graphs look like the one in this blog but the math behind it is still the same.</p>
<p>If we model this on a normal graph we get this:
<img src="/post/PerCapitaCoivd_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Quickly the data becomes impossible to visualise as it increases exponentially. We can manage this with logarithms, this way we can display a wide range of numerical data in a compact way.</p>
<center>
<span class="math inline">\(N = log(2^t)\)</span>
</center>
<p><img src="/post/PerCapitaCoivd_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
<div id="how-does-this-relate-to-per-capita" class="section level2">
<h2>2. How does this relate to Per Capita?</h2>
If we were representing this graph as per capita the equation would look like this:
<center>
<span class="math inline">\(N = log(\)</span><span class="math inline">\(\frac{2^t}{P}\)</span><span class="math inline">\()\)</span>
</center>
(where P = population)
Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_logarithmic_identities">Logarithmic Identities</a> this can be written like this:
<center>
<p><span class="math inline">\(N = log(2^t) - log(P)\)</span></p>
<span class="math inline">\(N = t*log(2) - log(P)\)</span>
</center>
<p>What this means is that adapting for Per Capita in a Logathirithmic graph <em>only shifts the graph up or down</em> by a factor of the population but it doesn’t change its shape. The most important aspect of the Covid-19 graph is their shape as this can tell you whether a country is peaked, recovering or still in the early stages of the disease. We can visualise this quite easily:</p>

<div id="isnt-adjustment-important-when-comparing-countries-anyway" class="section level3">
<h3>Isn’t adjustment important when comparing countries anyway?</h3>
<p>In most cases adjusting for Per Capita makes sense but in the case of viruses it doesn’t. That’s because a virus <strong>isn’t limited by population</strong> per se.</p>
<p>For example, take the country Malta as a theoretical example, it has a tiny popuation (only around 500,000) but it has one of the highest population density in the world (1,282 per square km). Since viruses only transfer from person to person in close proximity you would expect Malta to have a substantial amount of deaths.</p>
<p>Compare this to a country such as Russia which has a population of almost 150 million but has a population density of 8.4 people per square km. It is already incredibly hard to make a fair comparison between these two countries as each situation is drastically different and to adjust for population would only exercabete the problem.</p>
<p>In addition to this, Covid-19 does not affect everyone equally and older people are far more susceptible to the virus than younger people. Therefore, countries with ageing populations such as Italy and Japan would expect to have far more deaths than countries such as New Zealand.</p>
</div>
<div id="so-what-is-the-best-method" class="section level3">
<h3>So what is the best method?</h3>
<p>Ultimately, it depends what you are trying to portray.</p>
<p>If you are trying to demonstrate how far along a country is on the virus then there is no need to adjust the raw data at all.</p>
<p>If you are trying to compare countries to see who has dealt with the crisis better, the best way would be to adjust for age but keep in mind that there really is no silver bullet in this case and anything you do won’t quite show the whole picture.</p>
