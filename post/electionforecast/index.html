<p>I have released a forecast for the 2020 presidential election, which has been in the works for a couple of months. Originally, I did not expect it to take up so much of my time but I quickly released that Bayesian statistics has a rather steep learning curve. The forecast itself is at its core is very similar to <a href="https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president">The Economist’s model</a> as well as <a href="https://www.slate.com/features/pkremp_forecast/report.html">Pierre-Antoine Kremp’s</a> forecast from 2016. Both of these forecasts were derived from a paper from Drew Linzer and I have attempted to design a, more or less, direct implementation of his <a href="https://votamatic.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Linzer-JASA13.pdf">original paper</a>.</p>
<div id="why-i-built-it" class="section level2">
<h2>Why I built it</h2>
<p>Since this model is not particularly advanced it isn’t intended to compete with the more complex models such as the one at 538. Instead, it was more of an academic exercise and one step along the path to building models for UK elections with a long-range goal of developing a model for the next general election.</p>
<p>For the most part UK news organisations are quite far behind their US counterparts in how they interrogate and report on polling. All too often journalists report on polls sequentially: a new YouGov poll is released and it is treated as a perfectly accurate representation of popular opinion. To my knowledge there has also been no attempt by newsrooms to develop sophisticated polling averages. Now that this forecast is completed I plan to look towards using similar methods to develop averages which might better reflect the popular sentiment on a range of issues, such as voting intention, and which include the whole range of polling available to UK journalists.</p>
</div>
<div id="where-the-model-goes-wrong" class="section level2">
<h2>Where the model goes wrong</h2>
<p>Since this is a basic implementation it doesn’t take into account a poll’s house effect or adjust for its type . The prior forecast also doesn’t take into account the partisanship, which is generally understood to be a key metric in determining the outcomes in each state. Ultimately, this is a bare bones forecast that has only one criteria for state polls, that they are composed of “likely voters” rather than just “registered voters”. A more detailed description of the methodology is available on the model itself <a href="https://tomjs.org/Forecast2020/#method">here</a>.</p>
<p>These issues, amongst others, have led to the forecast being rather bullish. For example, a 68% chance of winning Texas is well outside the margins of most forecasts. However, this is mostly due to the difficulty of constructing accurate fundamental priors for the election (I have written more in-depth about the challenges of fundamental priors <a href="https://tomjs.org/post/introtomodelling/">here</a>). For my model I have used the <a href="https://pollyvote.com/en/components/models/retrospective/fundamentals-only-models/fair-model/">Fair model</a>, which has been used to predict elections since 1980. Unfortunately, due to Covid-19 and the precipitous deterioration in economic conditions it has been incredibly hard to design an accurate economic component for a fundamental prior. In the end, the values I have used have created a fundamental prior that expects Biden to win 51% of the vote and this has inevitably led to bullish predictions in a few red states such as Texas and Florida in which results can be close but historically lean Republican.</p>

<h2>A Technical Note</h2>
<p>The visualisation code for the model, and a fair bit of the computation, is done directly in the viewer’s browser. This makes the model, at least in theory, far easier to integrate into a CMS or existing website since it does not need server-side access and it is currently run entirely off GitHub Pages. The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/tomsaunders98/2020ElectionModel">GitHub</a> and if you have any feedback please let me know on twitter <span class="citation">[@tomjs]</span>(<a href="https://twitter.com/tomjs" class="uri">https://twitter.com/tomjs</a>).</p>
