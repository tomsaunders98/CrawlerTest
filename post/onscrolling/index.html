<p>Recently, I finished coding a <a href="https://tomjs.org/money/">dataviz project</a> which went into detail about the Treasury market in March. The idea behind it was to create a project which explored a relatively complex and under-reported issue (at least in the national papers) and use dataviz principles to simplify it.</p>
<p>The project uses scrolling as the singular prompt for all elements of the story. There is no clicking, dragging or dropdowns needed. I was drawn to this after reading Mike Bostock’s <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/scroll/">article</a> which expertly explores the technical and design aspects of visualisation-based scrolling.
In my opinion, scrolling is essentially a trade-off between elegance and control. On the one hand, scrolling as a function is ubiquitous and incredibly intuitive. Almost every web page contains scrolling, and so every web user is acquainted with its mechanics, no matter how technophobic they may be.</p>
<div id="positives" class="section level2">
<h2>Positives</h2>
<p>There has also been some talk amongst data journalists that extra functionality in the way of buttons to click or sliders to drag often aren’t worth the time they take to build, as the vast majority of readers don’t use them or don’t even notice them in the first place. This is far from ideal from a design perspective but scrolling completely solves this issue by tying the interactive elements of a story into the normal way someone reads a story: by scrolling.</p>
<p>In this regard, it is an incredibly elegant solution that has become more and more common across the web. The FT, along with The Pudding and others have created lots of visualisations that blend parallax scrolling and data animation.</p>
</div>
<div id="drawbacks" class="section level2">
<h2>Drawbacks</h2>
<p>However, there are some serious drawbacks to designing visualisation solely around scrolling as I came to realise rather quickly. You are essentially surrendering control of how your story is read to the reader and if you don’t technically adjust to this reality then your carefully crafted visualisations can break quite easily.</p>
<p>First of all, you can’t control how fast someone scrolls through a visualisation. From a technical aspect, when you scroll very fast through a carefully coded animation you can often break it by messing up the triggers.</p>
<p>Secondly, you can’t control which direction someone scrolls in and so all animations should in theory be reversible. You have to adjust for both of these issues when dealing with scrolling and I struggled in particular with the latter.</p>
<p>There are also the technical issues surrounding the fact that scroll event handlers will register one scroll as one trigger, regardless of how much of the page was scrolled through. This means extra work beyond simple event handlers are needed to adequately employ even the most basic scrolling events.</p>
<div id="my-project" class="section level3">
<h3>My Project</h3>
<p>My visualisation was built using d3js + jQuery, but if I were to do it again, I think I could rewrite the jQuery bits in pure JavaScript. This alone was enough to build all these mechanics, but it still is a lot of extra code and I found that things quickly become unwieldy. If I was to reattempt this I would go for a more modular approach, thinking about each type of animation separately, and ensuring that each is easily reversible and platform-agnostic.</p>
<p>I still believe that this is the only way forward for most forms of data journalism, especially those that are narrative based rather than standalone resources. However, at the same time, even though Mike Bostock’s article was published in 2014, scrolling is still technically difficult to use and largely underemployed in datajournalism.</p>
