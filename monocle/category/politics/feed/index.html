										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The royal family is always a difficult, but popular subject. What should be their role in society? Should they even have a role? Harry and Meghan are refreshingly honest in what they believe: they do not skirt around the truth, and have even allowed us to witness their human side. It is easy to see their hatred of the tabloid culture that is growing increasingly abhorrent in today’s society, and their desire for privacy. They appear to have been ostracised by the royal family for their latest endeavours, losing their HRH titles. Less than affectionately called “Megxit” by the tabloids, the media have showered Meghan with hate and blame. But what does this tell us about the royal family today?</p>



<p>The public eye has been a difficult place for Meghan Markle, with the media grabbing any information they could with eager hands, and beady eyes. It has obviously also taken a toll upon Harry, a man who could not escape the media especially after the tragic death of his mother, when he was a child. The tabloids lap up any “Diana” references they can, but prefer to forget the trauma they subjected Harry and William. The footage of the two boys walking behind her hearse is heart-breaking, and one that symbolises the debacle, particularly as Princess Diana’s car was speeding to escape the paparazzi. The personal perspective was lost in a media frenzy. So, when Harry moves toward privacy and family life, it is an understandable move. But, Meghan is inevitably blamed. As a woman new to the royal family, she is an easy target for the tabloids, and there have been a number of racist connotations toward her. They have also disrupted her private family relationships, publicly involving her father in a number of personal issues that have now been put in print.</p>



<p>It has always been an accepted fact that the media will scrutinise our royal family. However, it is debatable whether this is scrutiny, or just abuse. Whilst this is a boundary that the media have pushed for centuries, it is becoming increasingly personal, particularly in a media culture that depends upon “clicks”. Harry and Meghan’s latest move- to tell the tabloids they will no longer work with them- is laudable. But, simultaneously, it also seems like something that is long overdue. They should be applauded for their latest move, as it will finally give them some semblance of normal life. Harry and Meghan are not destined for Britain’s throne, and if they are aggressively hounded by the media whilst living their lives in Britain, why stay?</p>



<p>It will always be a scandal for a member of the royal family to desire privacy, and, in particular, to move abroad. It is far too a familiar scene that led to King Edward VIII’s abdication in 1936. Despite this being nearly a century ago, it remains infamous for the media and the royal family. They appear desperate to retain their position and earn forgiveness for the mishap of Edward VIII, who is amazingly remembered for his abdication more than his alliance with the Nazis. The media seem to be desperate for a scandal of these proportions and will go to some lengths to try and reinvent one in a world that is far removed from it. Particularly, a world that is battling a global pandemic.</p>



<p>If Meghan and Harry want to renounce their titles and live in peace, it should not matter. They are hardly the heirs apparent. However, the drama over it suggests that there is deep-seated insecurity of the supposed instability of the Windsor dynasty, one that is recognised by the royal family and media alike. They are desperate to have royals remain royal. Princess Anne did not allow her children, Peter Phillips, and Zara Tindall, to inherit her title, yet they remain very much in the public eye. It seems that we will never escape the obsession towards the royal family. No matter how far removed a prince may be, he is still a prince. Princes in fairy-tales always get their happy ending, but not in Britain. Here, they see their wife abused in the media, private communications leaked, pictures of his baby plastered everywhere, and constant reminders of the traumatic loss of his mother. The media needs to remember that behind every royal wave, there is a person.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At the Monocle we have been tracking how many Coronavirus tests have been performed for 33 different countries around the world. Testing for Covid-19 is often the mark by which a country’s response to the crisis is measured.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We have a simple message for all countries: test test test. Test every suspected case.</p><cite>World Health Organization (WHO) head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus</cite></blockquote>



<p>The UK government has been criticised for its lack of testing and some figures within government, such as the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, have made bold claims about scaling up testing.</p>



<p>The UK government has been criticised for its lack of testing and some figures within government, such as the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, have made bold claims about scaling up testing.</p>



<h1><strong>Matt Hancock says: 100,000 tests a day by end of April</strong></h1>



<p>Matt Hancock recently said that by the end of the month he hopes to have scaled up testing to 100,000 tests a day. On the face of it this seems like a tall order for a country which to date has only managed to administer slightly less than 300,000 tests.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1000testsperday.png?resize=1000%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-381" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1000testsperday.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1000testsperday.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1000testsperday.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The green line represents what 100,000 tests per day would look like, whilst the red line shows the UK’s current testing output since the 30<sup>th</sup> of March.</p>



<p>What is clear from this graph is that the daily increase in testing is only a fraction of the 100,000 goal. The gradient of the UK’s line looks almost flat in comparison to what 100,000 tests per day looks like. Indeed, from the 9<sup>th</sup> to the 10<sup>th </sup>of April, the UK only performed 16,095 tests which is nowhere near the 100,000 target.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether the UK can pull off such a huge increase over the next few weeks, although the initial data is not very encouraging.</p>



<h1><strong>Who is doing the most testing?</strong></h1>



<p>Whilst the UK may be struggling to increase its testing output, other countries have scaled up their diagnostics and production capabilities to wartime levels. </p>



<p>This graph showThis graph shows the highest tests output of all the countries monitored so far:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TestsArticle3.png?resize=1000%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-382" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TestsArticle3.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TestsArticle3.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TestsArticle3.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Unclear Measurement means that none was specified in the reported data. The measurement it most probably the number of Laboratory Samples Analysed</figcaption></figure>



<p>Germany has the second highest testing output of any country monitored, even though their data is over a week old. Whilst the UK does fairly well in this graph it must be noted that France’s data is also a week out of date compared to most countries and, even then, the UK is only marginally in front.  </p>



<h1><strong>Who is doing the best testing?</strong></h1>



<p>This is helpful to show which countries have the largest diagnostic and testing capabilities but a lot of the countries that the UK comes above have populations which are far smaller than the UK and so do not need to do anywhere near the amount of testing.</p>



<p>When adjusting for population the UK’s situation looks far worse:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTest5.png?resize=1000%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-383" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTest5.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTest5.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTest5.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Unclear Measurement means that none was specified in the reported data. The measurement it most probably the number of Laboratory Samples Analysed</figcaption></figure>



<p>Clearly, the UK’s testing output so far leaves a lot to be desired.</p>



<p>This also explains why some countries have a lower mortality rate than the United Kingdom. Countries such as Germany can afford to implement widespread testing; if you are suspected of having coronavirus in Germany you can quite easily get a test. However in the UK, due to the shortage of tests, only the most serious cases are tested which then inflates the overall mortality rate.</p>



<h1><strong>What about Japan?</strong></h1>



<p>According to Reuters Japan is only using 1/6<sup>th</sup> of its testing capacity. It is not exactly clear why Japan’s test output is so incredibly low compared to other developed nations.</p>



<p>Some have speculated that part of the reason is that companies and government bodies have been reluctant to take aggressive measures to combat the spread of the virus which may lead to heavy losses and an economic downturn.</p>



<p>It seems that aggressive testing is one of these measures that the government is unwilling to pursue.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In the first place, we believe there is not so much need for testing in Japan (as in other countries)</p><cite>Takuma Kato, deputy director of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare’s infectious diseases control division (March 11)</cite></blockquote>



<h1><strong>If we test more will the Lockdown by over sooner ? </strong></h1>



<p>Austria, Denmark and the Czech Republic have all announced plans to start easing social distancing restrictions.</p>



<p>There are many factors which go into beating the virus but it is interesting that all three countries have completed far more tests per capita than the UK.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTests1.png?resize=1000%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-384" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTests1.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTests1.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTests1.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Unclear Measurement means that none was specified in the reported data. The measurement it most probably the number of Laboratory Samples Analysed</figcaption></figure>



<p>Denmark has announced that schools and day care centres will reopen on the 15<sup>th</sup> of April and the Czech Republic has announced that it will expand the type of shops that are allowed to remain open. Austria has also announced that it will look to reopen some shops by the 14<sup>th</sup> April.</p>



<p>All three countries test far more people comparatively than the UK. The UK has indicated that the lockdown will almost certainly be extended. If the UK’s testing output is anything to go by, it might be extending for a whole lot longer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Monocle speaks to one of  the foremost experts in AI on the "open source" phenomenon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a small research centre nestled in the Alps in
south-western Switzerland, in 2002 a group of researchers released an
Artificial Intelligence framework free to the public. They released the
framework as “Open Source”, meaning that the framework was not only free to
use, but the underlying code was available for anyone to learn from it, adapt
it or copy it. </p>



<p>The framework enjoyed lasting popularity; its successor,
PyTorch, is used by Facebook and the lead developer of the framework, Samy
Bengio, is now a research scientist at Google. Mr Bengio explained that when
his team released Torch: “we were in a very academic environment, so open
sourcing seemed totally legitimate and useful for reproducibility.”</p>



<p>The Open Source model has been a key part of the academic
community for a long time. In 2001, 40 members of the editorial board of the
Artificial Intelligence journal Machine Learning resigned, explaining that in
the era of the Internet it was wrong for researchers to publish their findings
in expensive pay-access archives. </p>



<p>This mindset has found its way into big technology firms who
are desperate to hire leading academics in the field of Artificial
Intelligence: “Publishing and open-sourcing are both part of a healthy
scientific community” added Mr Bengio, “Good researchers in our field know
that, and they also know that they can somehow choose their employer more than
their employer can choose them.” The list of companies that have embraced the
Open Source movement in relation to Artificial Intelligence reads like a Who’s
Who of the Tech World, Google, Intel, Facebook, Uber, Lyft, Microsoft and even
DARPA have contributed to the dizzying quantity of freely available AI tools.</p>



<p>Academics have been able to keep AI a largely open research
area because they see the Open Source model as a way to ensure that the field
moves as quickly as possible; that academics are able to build on each other’s
work as quickly and efficiently as possible. </p>



<p>However, there are risks. The implications of AI advancements
have potentially world-shattering consequences. AI, Mr Bengio acknowledged,
“could also help bad actors build problematic tools that could be used to harm
society. Think for instance about face recognition technology used by rogue
governments.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it seems that this worst-case scenario has
already become a reality. Last week, it was reported that Mr Ton-That, a
college drop out and one-time model, used freely available academic papers and
open sourced AI products to perfect a Facial Recognition algorithm. It was used
in concert with billions of photos scraped from social networks to create a
program that can be used to identify anyone from one single photo. His company,
Clearview, has licensed his product out to Police departments across the United
States. </p>



<p>Google and Microsoft both refrained from open sourcing their
facial recognition algorithms for fear of this very thing happening. However,
the overwhelming quantity of freely available products and expertise meant that
their efforts were ultimately in vain. It’s unclear whether the open source
movement will continue in the same vain but whether it does is unlikely to
affect AI in the near future. Even products such as Google’s AI text-to-speech
generator, which was debuted to much fanfare in 2018 at Google’s annual
conference, has been recreated in open source by programmers even though the
real thing remains propriety.

What this means for the tech world is unclear,
but its consequences could be dire. Hackers have already used AI to impersonate
the CEO of a U.K.-based energy firm, running away with €220,000. When asked
about whether large technology firms will be as committed to open source in AI
as they are now, Mr Bengio replied: “I&#8217;m not really good at reading the future
:-).”

<h2>10) The Independent Group for Change</h2>



<p>It just wasn’t meant to be.</p>



<h2>9) UKIP</h2>



<p>Remember them?</p>



<h2>8) Bolsover</h2>



<p>David Skinner did lose his seat but ultimately Bolsover has
lost their beast, and are worse off because of it.</p>



<h2>7) Greens</h2>



<p>Over 800,000 votes for just one seat and who says our
electoral system isn’t broken?</p>



<h2>6) DUP/ Nigel Dodds</h2>



<p>In the preceding year the DUP have had more political power
than they have ever enjoyed in their lifetime and what have they got to show
for it? Their Westminster leader is out, there will be a border between
Northern Ireland and the UK and&nbsp; for the
first time there are more nationalist than loyalist MPs in Northern Ireland.
Nice.</p>



<h2>5) Brexit Party</h2>



<p>As entertaining as it would have been to see the polo-player
and property millionaire Richard Tice represent the northern constituency of
Hartlepool the Brexit Party couldn’t even manage that.</p>



<h2>4) Independent Tories</h2>



<p>Goodbye Dominic Grieve, Goodbye David Gauke, Goodbye uhhh everyone
else. I don’t remember there being so many of them.</p>



<h2>3) Heidi Allen / Unite for Remain</h2>



<p>Two reasons why the Remain effort would be better off
without Heidi Allen and the electoral pact between the Lib Dems, Greens and
Plaid Cymru: Stroud and Kensington. Both constituencies could have potentially
been won by Labour MPs if it wasn’t for Unite to Remain splitting the vote. </p>



<p>There are no reasons why the Remain effort would be better
off with Heidi Allen as her pact failed to win any seats at all. </p>



<h2>2) Jeremy Corbyn / Labour</h2>



<p>He won the argument but he couldn’t convert it into a majority, which is why he will be top of my next list: 10 biggest winners in things that don’t matter this election.</p>



<h2>1)Jo Swinson / Lib Dems</h2>



<p>She called the election. She claimed she was essential to
stopping Brexit and that she could be the next prime minister. Ultimately, she
somehow ended up doing the polar opposite of both of these: unemployed and
essential to getting Brexit done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Communication Workers Union (CWU), a postal union, have
been accused of making a “politically calculated” plan to strike over the
December election period, potentially jeopardising the counting of up to a
fifth of votes over disputes regarding bonuses and pay. </p>



<p>The Union, who on Monday revealed its latest strategy was to
refuse to deliver not only postal votes but also campaign material, are doing
so in order to prompt a new agreement by Royal Mail on jobs and conditions. </p>



<p>The move has triggered many concerned conversations on the
topic whether those not able to vote in their preferred constituency should
cancel postal vote registrations and vote by proxy instead, fearing millions of
votes going uncounted in arguably one of the most historic elections in recent
history. </p>



<p>The potential strike could hinder Corbyn’s own chances at
Number 10, potentially jeopardising the votes of thousands of students choosing
to vote in home constituencies whilst still being at university, or vice versa.
</p>



<p>However, due to the fact that almost half of Conservative
voters are aged 65 or over, and the age group are amongst the most likely in
society to request a postal vote, discussions have begun as to whether the move
was politically timed to boost the Labour Leader’s chances at the ballot box. </p>



<p>This prompted Andrea Leadsom, the Business Minister, to
suggest the CWU had indeed deliberately timed the potential strike. </p>



<p>“The timing of this threat is clearly politically calculated
and would disrupt both the election and people’s Christmas deliveries,” she
said.</p>



<p>She added the disruption would be “a taste of things to
come” if Jeremy Corbyn is elected prime minister next month. </p>



<p>Each general election, Royal Mail postal workers are given
compensation in the form of bonuses for the additional workload caused by
postal votes and significant amounts of campaign material. During the 2017
election these bonuses were set at an average of £267 each, a figure the
Communication Workers Union is demanding Royal Mail increases as part of wider
industrial disputes. </p>



<p>The 140,000 members of the CWU voted overwhelmingly in
favour of the strike, those in favour accounting for a staggering 97% of the
vote. Their reasons for striking covered a range of topics outside of just
bonuses, such as Royal Mail’s failure to uphold agreed deals on pensions and
conditions drawn up last year. </p>



<p>In a statement issued by Royal Mail, they remained committed to
ensuring the handling of postal election material “will be our number one
priority.” Shane O’Riordain continued, “We will invest significant resource to
seek to ensure a seamless process for the handling of postal election material.
Royal Mail volunteers will also work on the processing and delivery of election
mail.”</p>



<p>Regarding Royal Mail’s efforts to come to an agreement with the
CWU, Mr O’Riordain detailed “Royal Mail is also meeting the CWU as a matter of
urgency to discuss the union’s request for an increase in the dedicated
payments postmen and women receive for delivering each poll card and individual
item of candidate mail.” In addition, despite the growing frustration and
anxiety surrounding the situation, no strike action has definitely been
confirmed as of yet, “The recent ballot result for industrial action does not
necessarily mean that industrial action will take place.”</p>



<p>However, concern is not wholly unwarranted, as in the 2017 General
election over eight million votes were cast by post. Experts have warned that,
should significant disruption occur, the final election result could be left
open to legal action. </p>



<p>In addition to this, frustration over the supposed political
interest of the CWU seems to have stemmed from the union’s General Secretary,
Dave Ward’s close relationship to Jeremy Corbyn, claiming during the 2015
leadership campaign that Corbyn had to be elected to rid society of the
“Blairite virus”. </p>



<p>Described as a lifelong socialist, Mr Ward has been an active
union member since the 1970s, having joined Royal Mail at just 16 years old. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Amidst the chaos of Brexit, Britain has suddenly remembered about the other piece of its Kingdom.</p>



<p>&nbsp;But what of the politics of this strange land of bonfires and borders?&nbsp;Ahead of the upcoming election, <em>The Monocle&nbsp;</em>makes a brief inquiry into Northern Ireland’s political parties.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong> The Main Contenders</strong></p>



<p><strong>Democratic Unionist Party:&nbsp;</strong>We kick things off with the good folks who brought you homophobia and climate change denial. Still up in arms about the introduction of equal marriage and reproductive rights, expect them to make the most of their final gasp of relevance on a UK-wide level. Quite impressive in that each of their MPs manages to be individually dislikeable.</p>



<p><strong>Sinn Féin:&nbsp;</strong>The abstentionist republicans have made a strong start to their campaign to out-twat the DUP by having  IRA bomber and convicted mass murderer Sean Kelly canvass for one of their candidates. A further slip of the mask of inclusiveness came when their Queen’s University society displayed a ‘Brits Out’ banner during their Fresher’s Fair. But you can’t be wrong if you’re always the victim, right?</p>



<p><strong>Ulster Unionist Party:&nbsp;</strong>The more moderate unionist party’s incoming party leader Steve Aiken vowed to stand up to the DUP, and then immediately backtracked on a promise to field a candidate in every constituency to avoid splitting the unionist vote in North Belfast. That’ll show ‘em you’re not just a doormat.</p>



<p><strong>Social Democratic Labour Party:&nbsp;</strong>Sinn Féin’s more vanilla cousins are seeking to claw back moderate nationalist votes. As with the UUP, they’ve been steadily losing votes to the hardliners in recent years. You’d almost feel sorry for them if they weren’t so incredibly dull.</p>



<p><strong>Alliance Party:&nbsp;</strong>This liberal, non-sectarian party has long been the subject of scorn for its attempts to see past the religious divide. How dare they try to build a better future? The political equivalent of a plain ham sandwich and ready salted crisps meal deal.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"> <strong>And the Rest</strong></p>



<p><strong>Traditional Unionist Voice:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, this pro-Union party manages to make the DUP look a bit tame. Essentially the one-man-band of ex-DUP grandee Jim Allister, it remains to be seen whether they’ll bother standing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Green Party:</strong>They’re basically a Prius-driving Alliance Party but with an even more self-congratulatory support base. You can be sure all five of their voters will be sobbing over their quinoa when they don’t win any seats.</p>



<p><strong>Aontú:&nbsp;</strong>This new all-Ireland party is the brainchild of republicans impressed by the DUP’s example of turning the Old Testament into a political manifesto.&nbsp;The name means (*checks notes*) ‘unity’, which seems apt considering how they’ve managed to unite all the bad points of the DUP and Sinn Féin into one political abomination.</p>



<p><strong>People Before Profit:&nbsp;</strong>As the name suggests, they’re not big on the whole capitalism thing. It must be hard to start a revolution when nobody knows who you are.</p>



<p><strong>NI Conservatives:&nbsp;</strong>So irrelevant that Boris Johnson probably doesn’t know they exist. Essentially the San Marino football team of the political scene, you have them some credit for persisting even whilst getting decimated in every election.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last month the<a href="https://www.savethestudent.org/money/student-money-survey-2019.html"> Nation Student Money survey</a> was released by Save the Student. Now in its sixth year it polled 3,385 students, making it the UK’s largest independent survey of its kind. </p>



<p>The report had some dire revelations, most noticeably that
79% of students polled worry about making ends meet – which is more students
than ever before. Only 38% of students said that their maintenance loans
stretched far enough.</p>



<p>Not all students are able to supplement their maintenance
loan with money from their parents or an overdraft. Furthermore, contrary to
what people outside university might think, many students simply don’t have
time to take on a part-time job in addition to their studies.</p>



<p>This leaves students with few options in order to make ends
meet. This is where commercial or payday loan companies come into play. The
survey noted that the popularity of payday loans has increased from 2018 to
2019.</p>



<p>These payday loans are often exploitative, and many have
begun to directly target cash-strapped students. </p>



<p>Many student unions in the UK have banned short-term lends
from advertising on campus and have made active efforts to instead promote
hardship funds instead.</p>



<p>When you type “Student Loan quick” into Google plenty of
results come up. Many advertise loans from £100-£5,000 which can be agreed and
paid in 15 minutes. One of the most prominent of these pay-day lenders is Smart
Pig which describes itself as “the only short-term loan created just for
students.” </p>



<p>Smart Pig is a perfect example of how an offshoot of the
already morally questionable pay-day loan industry deliberately attempts to influence
vulnerable students into loans which will often lead them into more debt.</p>



<p>On the page “<a href="https://www.smart-pig.com/About_Us/Our%20Story">Our Story</a>”, Smart Pig mentions how the company is a student start up and that their founders “have a strong ethical focus …  and really want to improve practices and reduce prices in the short-term loan industry.” It is unclear exactly what Smart Pig means when it talks of its “strong ethical focus”.</p>



<p>The company has already been in trouble for advertising on
beer mats, on the basis that it connected payday loans with drinking. It also
was forced to scrap an ‘irresponsible’ poster offering a £3,500 prize because
it encouraged students to take on debt. The poster told students that “Every
customer is entered into our competition to win a term’s rent up to £3,500.” </p>



<p>Its founders, former Goldman Sachs trader and WBFF Amateur
Fitness model Tom Parks and Shreiff Benazina, also own another short-term loan
company called Buffa Loans. Buffa Loans features a picture of a mother and
child prominently on its landing page and advertises loans with a
representative APR of 1087%, which is more than double the 448% APR of Smart
Pig. For comparison the APR on fixed rate credit cards is around 13% and for
variable rate credit cards around 16%.</p>



<p>In a article in the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ac97f30-c5cf-11e5-b3b1-7b2481276e45">Financial Times</a>, Mr Benazina explained that “We don’t just want to do loans,” says Mr Benazina. “We want to help people find accommodation and practice for job interviews.” However, at the time of saying that Mr Benazina had been a Director of Buffa Loans, for over two years and seemed to be doing exactly that. The Smart-Pig About Page makes no mention anywhere of their other payday loan ventures and clearly attempts to appear as a solely student focused venture created by good natured students when in reality, they are quite far from that. </p>



<p>If you, or anyone you know, are facing financial difficulties or are unable to pay back a loan from a pay day lender you can contact your local <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/">Citizen’s Advice Bureau</a> for help or take a look at <a href="https://debtcamel.co.uk">DebtCamel </a>which has advice about payday loans and how you may be able to apply for compensation. Durham University and some colleges also have financial support and hardship funds available to students, you can find more information <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/student.finance/current/support/">here</a>.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Let me take it for you.</p>



<p>If you haven’t read the original piece by Liddle, I suggest that you don’t and that you stop reading this too. That way you’ll have withheld the one thing Rod Liddle needs to survive: attention.</p>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t turned back already then its already too late for you, you might as well read Liddle&#8217;s piece <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/11/if-you-do-one-thing-this-election-stop-your-kids-voting/amp/">here </a>and then come back.</p>



<p>Rod Liddle is a troll. Contrary to what most people think it wasn’t kids or the internet who inventing trolling, it was Rod Liddle. Long before 10-year olds were shouting racist epithets down a £10 Xbox mic, Rod Liddle was calling Muslims savages. Long before Fifa obsessed adolescents were telling girls to make them a sandwich, Rod was being a crusty old creep, propositioning Harriet Harman on the front page of the Spectator. </p>



<p>And when people took a step back and said, hold on Rod this
is actually pretty weird, what did he do? Why of course, he turned around, smirked
and revealed that it was all just a joke! You see, he wasn’t actually a creepy
old man he was merely parodying being a creepy old man. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When Liddle was accused of being a racist for printing blatantly
false claims about the African-Caribbean community, Liddle instead held up his
hands in surrender and claimed, he was just asking questions. </p>



<p>If this doesn’t sound like an internet troll to you then you
clearly have never been on the internet. In many ways he is the godfather of
trolling, he craves reaction and attention more than they do and by and large
he gets it.</p>



<p>Sure, there are others who would possibly stake a claim for his crown: Piers Morgan and Katy Hopkins come to mind. However, there is no question Rod was there first.</p>



<p>This latest article is just more of the same charade. However, with one caveat: all beasts, even trolls, are mortal. As trolls continue to scream for attention people gradually become accustomed to the ringing in their ears and learn to ignore it. This is why they have to change their tune.</p>



<p>Some just go for broke, a la Katy Hopkins calling for A Final Solution against all Muslims. But Rod, Rod is an auteur, he knows better. Instead he’s gone for a new target which will know doubt provide a bit of sustenance at least for a while. Of course, there is the usual drivel about Muslims and women, an old dog can’t learn new tricks that easily.</p>



<p>Ultimately, all things must come to an end and so must Rod
Liddle. Internet trolls usually get banned after a while from whatever platform
they are on. But the Spectator in the name of “Freeze Peach”, has valiantly defended
Rod and likely will until the bitter end. </p>



<p>As we all get accustomed to the peculiar form of Rod Liddle tinnitus
that we all bare (I call it Liddinitus) just remember that doctors agree that
the best cure is to go and do something productive engaging to distract
yourself. </p>



<p>So, go and vote and join the more than 270,000 people under
35 that have registered to vote in the last few days.</p>

<p>The Economist <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/10/18/the-strange-revival-of-vinyl-records">has
reported</a> that this year Vinyl sales are predicted to exceed those of the
CD. As one of the first concrete identifiers of the economic impact of the
hipster movement it’s fascinating to see the effect that moustachioed men in corduroy
trousers have had on our buying habits. </p>



<p>With this strange turn of events, where the development of a
subculture dedicated to ‘the aesthetic’ has resulted in the regression of
buying habits back to the 1980s, the Monocle is left wondering what other knickknacks
of yesteryear might yet make a comeback. </p>



<p>Why purchase a laptop or computer to help with your studies
when instead you could pick up a typewriter. Less convenient for sure, but some
argue that it really takes writing back to its ‘purest form’ (RIP the pen). &nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with replacing your laptop why not also replace your mobile
phone for a wired alternative that can plug into your landline at home. While
this would be infinitely less portable or adjusted for modern life, just like vinyl
records, some have argued that the sound quality makes it worth it and that ‘going
analogue’ is more reliable and secure. </p>



<p>While you’re at it why not pop by the newsagents (or Billy
B) to pick up a paper copy of your favourite (student) newspaper on your way.
Again, there’s no real reason such a thing should still exist outside of those
you get for free on the underground, but why let modern technology get in the
way of practicality by getting your news online, just like we here at the
Monocle aim to provide. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Will Kanye release his album tonight or not?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Kanye West has shocked the globe as it seems he may finally fulfil his role as a musician and release his music. He announced his much anticipated and much delayed gospel album will be released on the 25th October, but at the time of writing this there was no sign of said album as fans grow increasingly frustrated at the maverick artist.<br></p>



<p>Mr West informed fans on twitter that he was finishing mixing some tracks, and would ‘not sleep till this is done’, sending out serious student during summative season vibes.<br></p>



<p>The self professed ‘greatest artist of all time’ has already pushed back his album multiple times, and it has yet to be clarified if Kanye has the 25th October 2019 in mind. Some have speculated he is aiming for a 2020 release to coincide with a late run for the presidency, although unlikely he will run against his close friend Mr Trump.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Kanye, a man who once walked around calling himself Yeezus, has recently undergone a religious awakening, naming his new album Jesus Is King. Some of his new found christian beliefs include abolishing the 13th amendment (which outlawed slavery), calling slavery a choice, and throwing his support behind ultra right wing president Donald trump.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>He has also expressed regret over any explicit language used in his previous songs, citing his regression from writing Jesus Walks to I Love It, a song where he professes his everlasting love for Hoes, no doubt to the delight of his wife and kids. West suggested that ‘The devil was happy on that day’, but it remains highly unlikely anyone enjoyed that one.<br></p>



<p>Kanye likened the delay of his album to the frustration of Christians for the second coming of Christ in a recent interview with Complex. For now though, we can all put the second coming out our minds, and instead pray that Kanye drops the album sometime relatively soon.<br></p>
