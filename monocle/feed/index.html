<p>Juan Martinez, a Postgraduate student at Grey College, has been imprisoned for 18 months after ransacking rooms over the Christmas holidays.</p>



<p>Martinez, originally from Mexico, broke into a room where he stole two laptops, electrical items, jewellery and other personal items. He also stole 46 letters from the college post room.</p>



<p>Martinez was eventually caught in a female toilet block in the college on the 5<sup>th</sup> of January. However, this did little to deter him as he returned on 21<sup>st</sup> of January to steal a door lock and “numerous letters”.</p>



<p>He then returned on January 23<sup>rd</sup> to burgle the college again, armed with a knife.</p>



<p>On the 7<sup>th</sup> of July he was sentenced to 18 months in prison for three counts of burglary and one count of going equipped to burgle.</p>



<p>Honorary Recorder of Durham James Adkin stated: “I have heard that you are a man of good character and appear to be intelligent and graduated from Durham University.</p>



<p>I am not entirely sure what motivated you to commit these offences. Only a custodial sentence can be justified.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hundreds of students and Durhm locals turned out for the Black Lives Matter protest in Durham today. The peaceful protest began at Palace Green where protesters took a knee in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>



<p>Around 450 protests met in Palace Green, many with placards with slogans such as “the UK is not innocent” and “silence is violence”.</p>



<p>Counter-protesters assembled in market square, claiming that they were to “protect” Durham market square from vandalism.  </p>



<p>However, according to eye-witnesses, the counter-protesters attempted to disrupt the protests multiple times at both Milburngate and Claypath.</p>



<p>In any event, the BLM protest was entirely peaceful and by all accounts a successful show of solidarity with the wider BLM movement.</p>



<p>Jerome Yates, one of the organisers of the event, stated “I was over the moon with the turnout, which was amazing give the event was only officially created on Thursday.”</p>



<p>He added that “we wanted to show solidarity with the protests taking place across America and the UK today and to stress the need to change and action, especially with regards to education of injustices, biases and micro-aggressions that hurt People of Colour every single day.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The royal family is always a difficult, but popular subject. What should be their role in society? Should they even have a role? Harry and Meghan are refreshingly honest in what they believe: they do not skirt around the truth, and have even allowed us to witness their human side. It is easy to see their hatred of the tabloid culture that is growing increasingly abhorrent in today’s society, and their desire for privacy. They appear to have been ostracised by the royal family for their latest endeavours, losing their HRH titles. Less than affectionately called “Megxit” by the tabloids, the media have showered Meghan with hate and blame. But what does this tell us about the royal family today?</p>



<p>The public eye has been a difficult place for Meghan Markle, with the media grabbing any information they could with eager hands, and beady eyes. It has obviously also taken a toll upon Harry, a man who could not escape the media especially after the tragic death of his mother, when he was a child. The tabloids lap up any “Diana” references they can, but prefer to forget the trauma they subjected Harry and William. The footage of the two boys walking behind her hearse is heart-breaking, and one that symbolises the debacle, particularly as Princess Diana’s car was speeding to escape the paparazzi. The personal perspective was lost in a media frenzy. So, when Harry moves toward privacy and family life, it is an understandable move. But, Meghan is inevitably blamed. As a woman new to the royal family, she is an easy target for the tabloids, and there have been a number of racist connotations toward her. They have also disrupted her private family relationships, publicly involving her father in a number of personal issues that have now been put in print.</p>



<p>It has always been an accepted fact that the media will scrutinise our royal family. However, it is debatable whether this is scrutiny, or just abuse. Whilst this is a boundary that the media have pushed for centuries, it is becoming increasingly personal, particularly in a media culture that depends upon “clicks”. Harry and Meghan’s latest move- to tell the tabloids they will no longer work with them- is laudable. But, simultaneously, it also seems like something that is long overdue. They should be applauded for their latest move, as it will finally give them some semblance of normal life. Harry and Meghan are not destined for Britain’s throne, and if they are aggressively hounded by the media whilst living their lives in Britain, why stay?</p>



<p>It will always be a scandal for a member of the royal family to desire privacy, and, in particular, to move abroad. It is far too a familiar scene that led to King Edward VIII’s abdication in 1936. Despite this being nearly a century ago, it remains infamous for the media and the royal family. They appear desperate to retain their position and earn forgiveness for the mishap of Edward VIII, who is amazingly remembered for his abdication more than his alliance with the Nazis. The media seem to be desperate for a scandal of these proportions and will go to some lengths to try and reinvent one in a world that is far removed from it. Particularly, a world that is battling a global pandemic.</p>



<p>If Meghan and Harry want to renounce their titles and live in peace, it should not matter. They are hardly the heirs apparent. However, the drama over it suggests that there is deep-seated insecurity of the supposed instability of the Windsor dynasty, one that is recognised by the royal family and media alike. They are desperate to have royals remain royal. Princess Anne did not allow her children, Peter Phillips, and Zara Tindall, to inherit her title, yet they remain very much in the public eye. It seems that we will never escape the obsession towards the royal family. No matter how far removed a prince may be, he is still a prince. Princes in fairy-tales always get their happy ending, but not in Britain. Here, they see their wife abused in the media, private communications leaked, pictures of his baby plastered everywhere, and constant reminders of the traumatic loss of his mother. The media needs to remember that behind every royal wave, there is a person.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At the Monocle we have been tracking how many Coronavirus tests have been performed for 33 different countries around the world. Testing for Covid-19 is often the mark by which a country’s response to the crisis is measured.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We have a simple message for all countries: test test test. Test every suspected case.</p><cite>World Health Organization (WHO) head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus</cite></blockquote>



<p>The UK government has been criticised for its lack of testing and some figures within government, such as the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, have made bold claims about scaling up testing.</p>



<p>The UK government has been criticised for its lack of testing and some figures within government, such as the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, have made bold claims about scaling up testing.</p>



<h1><strong>Matt Hancock says: 100,000 tests a day by end of April</strong></h1>



<p>Matt Hancock recently said that by the end of the month he hopes to have scaled up testing to 100,000 tests a day. On the face of it this seems like a tall order for a country which to date has only managed to administer slightly less than 300,000 tests.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1000testsperday.png?resize=1000%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-381" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1000testsperday.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1000testsperday.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1000testsperday.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The green line represents what 100,000 tests per day would look like, whilst the red line shows the UK’s current testing output since the 30<sup>th</sup> of March.</p>



<p>What is clear from this graph is that the daily increase in testing is only a fraction of the 100,000 goal. The gradient of the UK’s line looks almost flat in comparison to what 100,000 tests per day looks like. Indeed, from the 9<sup>th</sup> to the 10<sup>th </sup>of April, the UK only performed 16,095 tests which is nowhere near the 100,000 target.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether the UK can pull off such a huge increase over the next few weeks, although the initial data is not very encouraging.</p>



<h1><strong>Who is doing the most testing?</strong></h1>



<p>Whilst the UK may be struggling to increase its testing output, other countries have scaled up their diagnostics and production capabilities to wartime levels. </p>



<p>This graph showThis graph shows the highest tests output of all the countries monitored so far:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TestsArticle3.png?resize=1000%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-382" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TestsArticle3.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TestsArticle3.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TestsArticle3.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Unclear Measurement means that none was specified in the reported data. The measurement it most probably the number of Laboratory Samples Analysed</figcaption></figure>



<p>Germany has the second highest testing output of any country monitored, even though their data is over a week old. Whilst the UK does fairly well in this graph it must be noted that France’s data is also a week out of date compared to most countries and, even then, the UK is only marginally in front.  </p>



<h1><strong>Who is doing the best testing?</strong></h1>



<p>This is helpful to show which countries have the largest diagnostic and testing capabilities but a lot of the countries that the UK comes above have populations which are far smaller than the UK and so do not need to do anywhere near the amount of testing.</p>



<p>When adjusting for population the UK’s situation looks far worse:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTest5.png?resize=1000%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-383" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTest5.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTest5.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTest5.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Unclear Measurement means that none was specified in the reported data. The measurement it most probably the number of Laboratory Samples Analysed</figcaption></figure>



<p>Clearly, the UK’s testing output so far leaves a lot to be desired.</p>



<p>This also explains why some countries have a lower mortality rate than the United Kingdom. Countries such as Germany can afford to implement widespread testing; if you are suspected of having coronavirus in Germany you can quite easily get a test. However in the UK, due to the shortage of tests, only the most serious cases are tested which then inflates the overall mortality rate.</p>



<h1><strong>What about Japan?</strong></h1>



<p>According to Reuters Japan is only using 1/6<sup>th</sup> of its testing capacity. It is not exactly clear why Japan’s test output is so incredibly low compared to other developed nations.</p>



<p>Some have speculated that part of the reason is that companies and government bodies have been reluctant to take aggressive measures to combat the spread of the virus which may lead to heavy losses and an economic downturn.</p>



<p>It seems that aggressive testing is one of these measures that the government is unwilling to pursue.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In the first place, we believe there is not so much need for testing in Japan (as in other countries)</p><cite>Takuma Kato, deputy director of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare’s infectious diseases control division (March 11)</cite></blockquote>



<h1><strong>If we test more will the Lockdown by over sooner ? </strong></h1>



<p>Austria, Denmark and the Czech Republic have all announced plans to start easing social distancing restrictions.</p>



<p>There are many factors which go into beating the virus but it is interesting that all three countries have completed far more tests per capita than the UK.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTests1.png?resize=1000%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-384" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTests1.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTests1.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTests1.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Unclear Measurement means that none was specified in the reported data. The measurement it most probably the number of Laboratory Samples Analysed</figcaption></figure>



<p>Denmark has announced that schools and day care centres will reopen on the 15<sup>th</sup> of April and the Czech Republic has announced that it will expand the type of shops that are allowed to remain open. Austria has also announced that it will look to reopen some shops by the 14<sup>th</sup> April.</p>



<p>All three countries test far more people comparatively than the UK. The UK has indicated that the lockdown will almost certainly be extended. If the UK’s testing output is anything to go by, it might be extending for a whole lot longer.</p>

<p>Durham University will scrap face to face teaching next week and students will be free, if they chose to, to go home early.</p>



<p>In an email to students this afternoon , the University stated that: &#8220;We will make every effort to ensure that all of you can participate in classes remotely until the Easter break. </p>



<p>You will also be able to access online materials over the Easter break for revision purposes.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Library will remain open until the end of term.</p>



<p>College accomodation will also operate as normal next week.</p>



<p>It is unclear at the moment if students will return to Durham in the final term. </p>



<p>There have been a total of twelve cases of Coronavirus in the North East. </p>



<p>Health officials confirmed the first case in County Durham on Tuesday in Darlington.</p>



<p>England&#8217;s deputy chief medical officer recently stated the peak coronavirus epidemic in the UK is expected within the next fortnight. At the time of writing, cases have risen to a total of 456 with eight deaths so far.</p>

<p>At Durham University Library, Hong Kong protesters stand in
a phalanx in silence, black masks over their faces, large cardboard posters in
their hands. Students, typically, take no notice. They walk past, generally
supportive but ultimately uninterested. However, today is different; opposite
the protesters stand a small group of pro-mainland students holding Chinese
flags. No words are spoken, but the air fills with a tentative silence. Other
students watch on, some in apprehension, others in fascination. The world has
come to Durham.</p>



<p>At the grassroot level, these pro-democracy confrontations
have spread rapidly across nations that have stayed studiously silent on the
protests. In small university towns, thousands of miles from China,
pro-democracy protesters are clashing with supporters of Xi Jinping’s
government, sometimes violently. Durham, with a population of less than 50,000,
is one of these small cities. With perpetual grey skies and more pubs than Uber
drivers, Durham has never been an international or multicultural city. However,
as in most university towns across the West, this is changing.</p>



<p>Data from the Higher Education Statistics Authority shows
that the number of Chinese students at Durham has increased by over 30% in the
last four years and they now make up almost ten per cent of the university
population. This trend is replicated across the UK: according to HESA, last
year 31% of international students across the UK were from China. This trend
has transformed these Hong Kong protests from staid, often sparsely attended
student rallies, into dangerous and potentially violent confrontations. In
Sheffield one student was arrested after a confrontation, in Queensland,
Australia, students have received death threats from counter-protesters.</p>



<p>Often these confrontations are less about calls for
democracy in Hong Kong than they are about identity. As one protest leader in
Durham explained: “in order to differentiate themselves they try to build up
this HK identity, and this whole prejudice is emerging.” These identities,
built on nationalism, have served to inhibit dialogue and entrench positions on
both sides. </p>



<p>However, the battle-lines are not as neatly drawn as people
may think. “Talking to a lot of people helps break down the stereotype of
Chinese people as embracing the communist party” one Hong Kong protester added.
“I’ve met loads of people with different opinions on the Chinese government”.
Often Chinese students are reticent to state their opinions in public, mindful
of the dangers, fearful of whom they can trust. One student protester explained
that he knew many mainland Chinese who were critical of their government but as
he put it mildly, they “would be a bit wary” of voicing those beliefs.</p>



<p>As is often the case, dialogue between the groups, both formal
and informal, has engendered understanding and amongst some, acceptance. As one
Hong Kong protester reflected: “So I think a lot of people were wary of us, but
through talking we have managed to convince a few that our objectives are
peaceful … even to Chinese people we shouldn’t be seen as enemies.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Monocle speaks to one of  the foremost experts in AI on the "open source" phenomenon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a small research centre nestled in the Alps in
south-western Switzerland, in 2002 a group of researchers released an
Artificial Intelligence framework free to the public. They released the
framework as “Open Source”, meaning that the framework was not only free to
use, but the underlying code was available for anyone to learn from it, adapt
it or copy it. </p>



<p>The framework enjoyed lasting popularity; its successor,
PyTorch, is used by Facebook and the lead developer of the framework, Samy
Bengio, is now a research scientist at Google. Mr Bengio explained that when
his team released Torch: “we were in a very academic environment, so open
sourcing seemed totally legitimate and useful for reproducibility.”</p>



<p>The Open Source model has been a key part of the academic
community for a long time. In 2001, 40 members of the editorial board of the
Artificial Intelligence journal Machine Learning resigned, explaining that in
the era of the Internet it was wrong for researchers to publish their findings
in expensive pay-access archives. </p>



<p>This mindset has found its way into big technology firms who
are desperate to hire leading academics in the field of Artificial
Intelligence: “Publishing and open-sourcing are both part of a healthy
scientific community” added Mr Bengio, “Good researchers in our field know
that, and they also know that they can somehow choose their employer more than
their employer can choose them.” The list of companies that have embraced the
Open Source movement in relation to Artificial Intelligence reads like a Who’s
Who of the Tech World, Google, Intel, Facebook, Uber, Lyft, Microsoft and even
DARPA have contributed to the dizzying quantity of freely available AI tools.</p>



<p>Academics have been able to keep AI a largely open research
area because they see the Open Source model as a way to ensure that the field
moves as quickly as possible; that academics are able to build on each other’s
work as quickly and efficiently as possible. </p>



<p>However, there are risks. The implications of AI advancements
have potentially world-shattering consequences. AI, Mr Bengio acknowledged,
“could also help bad actors build problematic tools that could be used to harm
society. Think for instance about face recognition technology used by rogue
governments.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it seems that this worst-case scenario has
already become a reality. Last week, it was reported that Mr Ton-That, a
college drop out and one-time model, used freely available academic papers and
open sourced AI products to perfect a Facial Recognition algorithm. It was used
in concert with billions of photos scraped from social networks to create a
program that can be used to identify anyone from one single photo. His company,
Clearview, has licensed his product out to Police departments across the United
States. </p>



<p>Google and Microsoft both refrained from open sourcing their
facial recognition algorithms for fear of this very thing happening. However,
the overwhelming quantity of freely available products and expertise meant that
their efforts were ultimately in vain. It’s unclear whether the open source
movement will continue in the same vain but whether it does is unlikely to
affect AI in the near future. Even products such as Google’s AI text-to-speech
generator, which was debuted to much fanfare in 2018 at Google’s annual
conference, has been recreated in open source by programmers even though the
real thing remains propriety.

What this means for the tech world is unclear,
but its consequences could be dire. Hackers have already used AI to impersonate
the CEO of a U.K.-based energy firm, running away with €220,000. When asked
about whether large technology firms will be as committed to open source in AI
as they are now, Mr Bengio replied: “I&#8217;m not really good at reading the future
:-).”

<p>Lilian
Groves knows Durham. She was an undergraduate at the university, then a
lecturer and eventually the Vice Principal of Hilde-Bede college. Three weeks after
retiring she became a tour-guide for Durham Cathedral and 20 years later, at
the age of 91, she is still there.</p>



<p>Thinking
about her proudest moment she told me, full of modesty, “I suppose it was being
chosen as what was that called? Visit England Superstar. That was probably it.”</p>



<p>In
fact, in 2016 she won Durham Tourism Superstar and later in the same year the
national equivalent, Visit England Superstar. However, according to Lilian “it
was the lead up to it that was amazing as anything else. One of the cannons in
the cathedral wrote a song which the choristers sang, and it went viral.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ever
modest, she assured me all she had won was “a hideous plaque and a huge framed
certificate which is sitting on the floor in my study.”</p>



<p>When I
asked her who her favourite visitor was, she replied cautiously: “It’s hard to
say. I’ve taken Sting who told me that he wanted to adopt me as his mother.
I’ve taken Princess Anne, she was terrific fun, marvellous sense of humour.”</p>



<p>However,
her favourite was a local woman from Sunderland. Lilian explained that “she
came on a public tour and at the end of the tour she crossed my hands and said,
‘flower I wouldn’t have missed that for a million pounds.’ And I thought that
was brilliant, absolutely brilliant.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>10) The Independent Group for Change</h2>



<p>It just wasn’t meant to be.</p>



<h2>9) UKIP</h2>



<p>Remember them?</p>



<h2>8) Bolsover</h2>



<p>David Skinner did lose his seat but ultimately Bolsover has
lost their beast, and are worse off because of it.</p>



<h2>7) Greens</h2>



<p>Over 800,000 votes for just one seat and who says our
electoral system isn’t broken?</p>



<h2>6) DUP/ Nigel Dodds</h2>



<p>In the preceding year the DUP have had more political power
than they have ever enjoyed in their lifetime and what have they got to show
for it? Their Westminster leader is out, there will be a border between
Northern Ireland and the UK and&nbsp; for the
first time there are more nationalist than loyalist MPs in Northern Ireland.
Nice.</p>



<h2>5) Brexit Party</h2>



<p>As entertaining as it would have been to see the polo-player
and property millionaire Richard Tice represent the northern constituency of
Hartlepool the Brexit Party couldn’t even manage that.</p>



<h2>4) Independent Tories</h2>



<p>Goodbye Dominic Grieve, Goodbye David Gauke, Goodbye uhhh everyone
else. I don’t remember there being so many of them.</p>



<h2>3) Heidi Allen / Unite for Remain</h2>



<p>Two reasons why the Remain effort would be better off
without Heidi Allen and the electoral pact between the Lib Dems, Greens and
Plaid Cymru: Stroud and Kensington. Both constituencies could have potentially
been won by Labour MPs if it wasn’t for Unite to Remain splitting the vote. </p>



<p>There are no reasons why the Remain effort would be better
off with Heidi Allen as her pact failed to win any seats at all. </p>



<h2>2) Jeremy Corbyn / Labour</h2>



<p>He won the argument but he couldn’t convert it into a majority, which is why he will be top of my next list: 10 biggest winners in things that don’t matter this election.</p>



<h2>1)Jo Swinson / Lib Dems</h2>



<p>She called the election. She claimed she was essential to
stopping Brexit and that she could be the next prime minister. Ultimately, she
somehow ended up doing the polar opposite of both of these: unemployed and
essential to getting Brexit done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Monocle sits down with participants in the Hong Kong protests in Durham. </p>



<p>The protests in Hong Kong have been unlike any other in
recent memory. Geographically they may be far away. However, they have ignited
protest organically in universities across the globe from Brisbane to Bristol.</p>



<p>Just recently a total of 78 Hong Kong-affiliated student
groups from across the globe released a <em>Joint Statement on Police Brutality
and Academic Freedom</em>. The full list of signatories includes groups in the
Netherlands, Los Angeles, New Zealand and of course Durham.</p>



<p>At the Monocle we sat down with members of the Durham Hong Kong protests to understand how this international phenomenon arose and what it is all about. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1300" height="975" src="https://i0.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-5-done.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-330" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-5-done.jpg?w=1300&amp;ssl=1 1300w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-5-done.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-5-done.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-5-done.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<h1>How the protests came about</h1>



<p>The organisers were initially very clear to emphasise that
there was no central chain of command linking these protest groups from across
the world.</p>



<p>“It’s not centralised at all, it’s very similar to the movement itself back home, there is no central platform, it is all people coming out and saying: we don’t want this.”</p>



<p>The decentralisation of the movement is more than merely circumstantial,
in many ways it seems to be what has made them so incredibly effective.</p>



<p>“When I have signed up to be a helper in a London protest, I am not notified about anything until last minute and everything still works out fine. I think this not only represents how the leaderless thing works, but how it has become the characteristic of HK people all over the world.”</p>



<p>“It shows that not everything is centralised, and everyone has their own say in the whole movement as well.”</p>



<h1>Dealing with counter-protests</h1>



<p>The protests have been met with some opposition and there
have been some incidents in which Hong Kong protesters have come into contact
with counter-protesters.</p>



<p>The protesters mentioned an incident which took place at Sheffield University where one man was arrested in a counter-protest under suspicion of committing a public order offence.</p>



<p>After this interview took place, there was a counter
demonstration by Chinese supporters to the Hong Kong protesters. The atmosphere
was tense.</p>



<p>“We know there are risks of counter protesters, but we believe dialogue is the most important thing. The fact we are lucky enough to study at university and have this opportunity whereas a lot of places around the world don’t have this space for dialogue. Therefore, it is important to talk to as many people as possible even though we know they have different preconceptions of our movement.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1243" height="932" src="https://i0.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-3-another.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-329" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-3-another.jpg?w=1243&amp;ssl=1 1243w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-3-another.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-3-another.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-3-another.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<h1>What is it like in Hong Kong?</h1>



<p>Whilst English universities have supported the Hong Kong protestors&#8217; right to free speech, and Durham is no exception, the reality in Hong Kong as most know is very different.</p>



<p>“Often the running joke is, because many of the people in the protests are quite young, often secondary school students, and the skill which they’ve learnt over the summer is the ability to diffuse teargas in a few seconds. That’s not the experience some of us have but it’s the idea that you will be affected by teargas one way or the other. You can be coming off work, or having a meal with somebody, and you’ll see teargas going off somewhere.”</p>



<p>“It’s something ridiculous like 80% of all HK people have been affected by teargas.”</p>

</div><figcaption>August 31 inside a train</figcaption></figure>



<h1>What do they want?</h1>



<p>Often people assume that what the Hong Kong protests are all about is independence from China, but the people we talked to were all quick to emphasise that this is far from their main goal</p>



<p>“The line of argument often going against the Hong Kong movement is that HK is trying to get away from China, it’s a territorial dispute, but no this is absolutely not what we are trying to do.”</p>



<p>In fact, what unites the protests all around the world as
well as Hong Kong are five relatively simple demands:</p>



<ol><li>Formal withdrawal of the extradition bill.</li><li>Exoneration and release of arrested protesters.</li><li>Independent commission and enquiry into police brutality .</li><li>The government to withdraw the use of the word “riot” in relation to protests.</li><li>Implementation of genuine universal suffrage.</li></ol>



<p>Ultimately, it seems that the protests in Durham and around
the world are about exercising their respective right to free speech in support
of those whose right is under threat.</p>



<p>“University is and should be a place of freedom of speech and expression it is a very good place to show what this is about and show that in fact free speech and expression isn’t always the case around the world nowadays as we see in Hong Kong.”</p>
