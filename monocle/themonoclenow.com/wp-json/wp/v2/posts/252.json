It was deemed that leaving students with a potential criminal record due to noise complaints was an &#8216;inappropriate&#8217; use of the law.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of new strategies, police agreed to trial a new tactic of having uniformed officers knock on doors whilst the prospect of more night-time wardens in problematic areas was also considered. Moreover, the idea of student volunteers performing similar duties on the streets was discussed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Durham University declined to be part of the panel, which included various members from local politics and the wider civic community. Despite this, the university&#8217;s pro-vice chancellor Jeremy Cook and community liaison officer Hannah Shepherd both took part in the conference. Students&#8217; Union president Kate McIntosh was also in attendance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amongst the topics discussed was the possibility of a bespoke alcohol licensing policy being introduced for Durham City. This comes amidst complaints from residents about the ineffectiveness of the current response to antisocial behaviour, which they claim is doing little to combat the sleepless nights caused by noisy students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, it was agreed that there could be no quick fix to the issues being faced and that different sectors of the community working together was the only way forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Durham City Council Announce End to Community Protection Orders for Student Noise Complaints<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":9,"featured_media":270,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[2],"tags":[14],"cc_featured_image_caption":{"caption_text":"","source_text":"\"Durham\" by James.Stringer is licensed under CC BY-NC 2.0 ","source_url":"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/28370443@N08\/47801854362"},"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/47801854362_205bfe8f01_h.jpg?fit=1600%2C972&ssl=1","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 -
