On the face of it this seems like a tall order for a country which to date has only managed to administer slightly less than 300,000 tests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/1000testsperday.png?resize=1000%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-381\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/1000testsperday.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/1000testsperday.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/1000testsperday.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The green line represents what 100,000 tests per day would look like, whilst the red line shows the UK\u2019s current testing output since the 30<sup>th<\/sup> of March.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is clear from this graph is that the daily increase in testing is only a fraction of the 100,000 goal. The gradient of the UK\u2019s line looks almost flat in comparison to what 100,000 tests per day looks like. Indeed, from the 9<sup>th<\/sup> to the 10<sup>th <\/sup>of April, the UK only performed 16,095 tests which is nowhere near the 100,000 target.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It remains to be seen whether the UK can pull off such a huge increase over the next few weeks, although the initial data is not very encouraging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1><strong>Who is doing the most testing?<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst the UK may be struggling to increase its testing output, other countries have scaled up their diagnostics and production capabilities to wartime levels. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This graph showThis graph shows the highest tests output of all the countries monitored so far:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/TestsArticle3.png?resize=1000%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-382\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/TestsArticle3.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/TestsArticle3.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/TestsArticle3.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption>Unclear Measurement means that none was specified in the reported data.

Countries such as Germany can afford to implement widespread testing; if you are suspected of having coronavirus in Germany you can quite easily get a test. However in the UK, due to the shortage of tests, only the most serious cases are tested which then inflates the overall mortality rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1><strong>What about Japan?<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Reuters Japan is only using 1\/6<sup>th<\/sup> of its testing capacity. It is not exactly clear why Japan\u2019s test output is so incredibly low compared to other developed nations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some have speculated that part of the reason is that companies and government bodies have been reluctant to take aggressive measures to combat the spread of the virus which may lead to heavy losses and an economic downturn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems that aggressive testing is one of these measures that the government is unwilling to pursue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>In the first place, we believe there is not so much need for testing in Japan (as in other countries)<\/p><cite>Takuma Kato, deputy director of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare\u2019s infectious diseases control division (March 11)<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h1><strong>If we test more will the Lockdown by over sooner ? <\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Austria, Denmark and the Czech Republic have all announced plans to start easing social distancing restrictions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many factors which go into beating the virus but it is interesting that all three countries have completed far more tests per capita than the UK.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/ArticleTests1.png?resize=1000%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-384\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/ArticleTests1.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/ArticleTests1.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/ArticleTests1.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption>Unclear Measurement means that none was specified in the reported data.
