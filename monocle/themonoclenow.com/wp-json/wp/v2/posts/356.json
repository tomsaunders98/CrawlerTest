Division in Durham."},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>At Durham University Library, Hong Kong protesters stand in\na phalanx in silence, black masks over their faces, large cardboard posters in\ntheir hands. Students, typically, take no notice. They walk past, generally\nsupportive but ultimately uninterested. However, today is different; opposite\nthe protesters stand a small group of pro-mainland students holding Chinese\nflags. No words are spoken, but the air fills with a tentative silence. Other\nstudents watch on, some in apprehension, others in fascination. The world has\ncome to Durham.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the grassroot level, these pro-democracy confrontations\nhave spread rapidly across nations that have stayed studiously silent on the\nprotests. In small university towns, thousands of miles from China,\npro-democracy protesters are clashing with supporters of Xi Jinping\u2019s\ngovernment, sometimes violently. Durham, with a population of less than 50,000,\nis one of these small cities. With perpetual grey skies and more pubs than Uber\ndrivers, Durham has never been an international or multicultural city. However,\nas in most university towns across the West, this is changing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data from the Higher Education Statistics Authority shows\nthat the number of Chinese students at Durham has increased by over 30% in the\nlast four years and they now make up almost ten per cent of the university\npopulation. This trend is replicated across the UK: according to HESA, last\nyear 31% of international students across the UK were from China. This trend\nhas transformed these Hong Kong protests from staid, often sparsely attended\nstudent rallies, into dangerous and potentially violent confrontations. In\nSheffield one student was arrested after a confrontation, in Queensland,\nAustralia, students have received death threats from counter-protesters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often these confrontations are less about calls for\ndemocracy in Hong Kong than they are about identity. As one protest leader in\nDurham explained: \u201cin order to differentiate themselves they try to build up\nthis HK identity, and this whole prejudice is emerging.\u201d These identities,\nbuilt on nationalism, have served to inhibit dialogue and entrench positions on\nboth sides. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the battle-lines are not as neatly drawn as people\nmay think. \u201cTalking to a lot of people helps break down the stereotype of\nChinese people as embracing the communist party\u201d one Hong Kong protester added.\n\u201cI\u2019ve met loads of people with different opinions on the Chinese government\u201d.\nOften Chinese students are reticent to state their opinions in public, mindful\nof the dangers, fearful of whom they can trust. One student protester explained\nthat he knew many mainland Chinese who were critical of their government but as\nhe put it mildly, they \u201cwould be a bit wary\u201d of voicing those beliefs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As is often the case, dialogue between the groups, both formal\nand informal, has engendered understanding and amongst some, acceptance. As one\nHong Kong protester reflected: \u201cSo I think a lot of people were wary of us, but\nthrough talking we have managed to convince a few that our objectives are\npeaceful \u2026 even to Chinese people we shouldn\u2019t be seen as enemies.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Monocle takes a look at an the Hong Kong protest movement and its relevance to Durham.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":328,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[2],"tags":[11],"cc_featured_image_caption":{"caption_text":"","source_text":"","source_url":""},"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/pic-2main.jpg?fit=2046%2C1534&ssl=1","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>One Protest Two Countries.
