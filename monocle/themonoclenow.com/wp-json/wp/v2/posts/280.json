That way you\u2019ll have withheld the one thing Rod Liddle needs to survive: attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t turned back already then its already too late for you, you might as well read Liddle&#8217;s piece <a href=\"https:\/\/www.spectator.co.uk\/2019\/11\/if-you-do-one-thing-this-election-stop-your-kids-voting\/amp\/\">here <\/a>and then come back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rod Liddle is a troll. Contrary to what most people think it wasn\u2019t kids or the internet who inventing trolling, it was Rod Liddle. Long before 10-year olds were shouting racist epithets down a \u00a310 Xbox mic, Rod Liddle was calling Muslims savages. Long before Fifa obsessed adolescents were telling girls to make them a sandwich, Rod was being a crusty old creep, propositioning Harriet Harman on the front page of the Spectator. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when people took a step back and said, hold on Rod this\nis actually pretty weird, what did he do? Why of course, he turned around, smirked\nand revealed that it was all just a joke! You see, he wasn\u2019t actually a creepy\nold man he was merely parodying being a creepy old man. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Liddle was accused of being a racist for printing blatantly\nfalse claims about the African-Caribbean community, Liddle instead held up his\nhands in surrender and claimed, he was just asking questions. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this doesn\u2019t sound like an internet troll to you then you\nclearly have never been on the internet. In many ways he is the godfather of\ntrolling, he craves reaction and attention more than they do and by and large\nhe gets it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, there are others who would possibly stake a claim for his crown: Piers Morgan and Katy Hopkins come to mind. However, there is no question Rod was there first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This latest article is just more of the same charade. However, with one caveat: all beasts, even trolls, are mortal. As trolls continue to scream for attention people gradually become accustomed to the ringing in their ears and learn to ignore it. This is why they have to change their tune.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some just go for broke, a la Katy Hopkins calling for A Final Solution against all Muslims. But Rod, Rod is an auteur, he knows better. Instead he\u2019s gone for a new target which will know doubt provide a bit of sustenance at least for a while. Of course, there is the usual drivel about Muslims and women, an old dog can\u2019t learn new tricks that easily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, all things must come to an end and so must Rod\nLiddle. Internet trolls usually get banned after a while from whatever platform\nthey are on. But the Spectator in the name of \u201cFreeze Peach\u201d, has valiantly defended\nRod and likely will until the bitter end. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we all get accustomed to the peculiar form of Rod Liddle tinnitus\nthat we all bare (I call it Liddinitus) just remember that doctors agree that\nthe best cure is to go and do something productive engaging to distract\nyourself. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, go and vote and join the more than 270,000 people under\n35 that have registered to vote in the last few days.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tom takes Rod Liddle&#8217;s bait so you don&#8217;t have to.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":281,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[11],"cc_featured_image_caption":{"caption_text":"","source_text":"","source_url":""},"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/angler-47458_1280.png?fit=1280%2C640&ssl=1","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 -
