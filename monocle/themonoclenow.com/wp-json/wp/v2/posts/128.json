Members of our research group, who were keenly researching the Europine countries this week yonder, have had word that a certain cowed and much brow endowed gentleman of our house hath entered into a Faustian bargain with the many-faced devil of Europe. Of which face he made his pact we cannot say but it was most likely the craven face of France or the sour fa\u00e7ade of the Kraut. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may say, by Jove who is this much brow endowed man for he I shall disavow! But fear not my fellow, for we have plans for this beast. Our researchers, when not researching the countries of that hateful continent, have been deeply involved in crafting a law which will throw such men in the Tower alongside the likes of Guy Fawkes and others who seek to lie in the bed of a foreigner \u2013 sorry I mean foreign nation. Our experts have devised a law modelled on that of the United States, the Logan Act. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are those against us who say that modelling a law on one which was instituted in 1799, which only 2 people were ever indicted on (in 1802 and 1852) and even then, neither were convicted is somehow a \u201cbad idea\u201d. To them I say wasn\u2019t it so that those were in fact the best of times? When a sea sturdy and strong kept the countries of Europe at bay and our navy ruled the seven seas with an iron but benevolent fist. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The countries of the Occident and the Orient, united in their adulation of the English way. I say why shouldn\u2019t we look to this sacred time for inspiration in our dastardly present. Perhaps we can indeed build Jerusalem here again, among the dark Satanic Mills of Europe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, there are those who say you should inquire as to your own fold, not to peer too deeply into the abyss of our house. They claim, that there are those amongst our own number guilty of this treacherous sin! They point to our gentleman-in-arms, Daniel Kawczynski, who has asked Poland <a href=\"https:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/polish-born-mp-accused-of-reckless-attempt-to-block-brexit-delay-11615428\">time <\/a>and <a href=\"https:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/tory-mp-daniel-kawczynski-defends-bid-to-get-poland-to-veto-brexit-delay-11841185\">time <\/a>again to veto an extension to Brexit. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some claim that colluding with a foreign nation against the interests of the government might  somehow   violate the aforementioned Logan Act. To this I say poppycock, pipsqueak, pifflepaffle! When one rides the waves of the 52%  he may not represent the interests of his government, but he doth represent the interests of the nation! In our expert opinion it is the government of May itself who must be prosecuted, for colluding with a foreign power to enact an extension against the tsunamic consensus of the good and decent folk of our green and pleasant lands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alas, I hear the nation calling, I hear her crying out to me\nand I must serve her will and obtain the Brexit I know she so deeply desired.\nAs such I must draw this letter to a close forthwith.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the words of the Honourable Reverend <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/henrysacheverell\/\">Dr. Henry Sacheverell<\/a>,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Brexit hardened for a nation heartened.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yours Faithfully,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your humble servant.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A Letter from the League of English Reactionary Gentlemen<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":135,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[11],"cc_featured_image_caption":{"caption_text":"Oliver Letwin, his huge brows illuminated, Cabinet Office","source_text":"OGL v1.0","source_url":"http:\/\/www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk\/content\/oliver-letwin-minister-state-cabinet-office"},"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/letwin3.png?fit=1000%2C500&ssl=1","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 -
