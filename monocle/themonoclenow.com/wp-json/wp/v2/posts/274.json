These\nchanges would have led to UCU members being approximately \u00a3240,000 worse off\ndue to changes in the pension scheme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results of the vote were first reported by the UCU on\nthe 31<sup>st<\/sup> of October. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UCU of Durham also backed strike action due to pay\ncasualisation, equality and workloads. A recent report by the Universities and Colleges\nEmployers Association UCEA showed that pay for university staff has dropped by\naround 17% in real terms since 2009.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year university campuses including Durham were brought\nto a standstill over the USS pension scheme. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UCU general secretary Jo Grady said: \u201c&#8217;It is incredibly\nfrustrating that we had to ballot members again, but universities only have\nthemselves to blame after failing to address falling real-terms pay and for\nrefusing to deal with casualisation, workloads and the rising cost of USS\npensions.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The strike action has been received positively by most Student Unions. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner called on both sides to get around the table for urgent talks and said that she fully supported UCU members fighting for fair pay and decent pensions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Durham Student Union President Kate McIntosh stated on twitter, that she was unequivocally in support of the strike but that strike action must be member-led.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;m unequivical in my support for the right to strike &#8211; I know students really  care about fair pay &amp; pensions for uni staff. That said, strike action must be member-led.
