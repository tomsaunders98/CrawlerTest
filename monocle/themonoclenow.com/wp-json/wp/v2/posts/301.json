During the 2017\nelection these bonuses were set at an average of \u00a3267 each, a figure the\nCommunication Workers Union is demanding Royal Mail increases as part of wider\nindustrial disputes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 140,000 members of the CWU voted overwhelmingly in\nfavour of the strike, those in favour accounting for a staggering 97% of the\nvote. Their reasons for striking covered a range of topics outside of just\nbonuses, such as Royal Mail\u2019s failure to uphold agreed deals on pensions and\nconditions drawn up last year. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a statement issued by Royal Mail, they remained committed to\nensuring the handling of postal election material \u201cwill be our number one\npriority.\u201d Shane O\u2019Riordain continued, \u201cWe will invest significant resource to\nseek to ensure a seamless process for the handling of postal election material.\nRoyal Mail volunteers will also work on the processing and delivery of election\nmail.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding Royal Mail\u2019s efforts to come to an agreement with the\nCWU, Mr O\u2019Riordain detailed \u201cRoyal Mail is also meeting the CWU as a matter of\nurgency to discuss the union\u2019s request for an increase in the dedicated\npayments postmen and women receive for delivering each poll card and individual\nitem of candidate mail.\u201d In addition, despite the growing frustration and\nanxiety surrounding the situation, no strike action has definitely been\nconfirmed as of yet, \u201cThe recent ballot result for industrial action does not\nnecessarily mean that industrial action will take place.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, concern is not wholly unwarranted, as in the 2017 General\nelection over eight million votes were cast by post. Experts have warned that,\nshould significant disruption occur, the final election result could be left\nopen to legal action. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to this, frustration over the supposed political\ninterest of the CWU seems to have stemmed from the union\u2019s General Secretary,\nDave Ward\u2019s close relationship to Jeremy Corbyn, claiming during the 2015\nleadership campaign that Corbyn had to be elected to rid society of the\n\u201cBlairite virus\u201d. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Described as a lifelong socialist, Mr Ward has been an active\nunion member since the 1970s, having joined Royal Mail at just 16 years old. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Student votes could go uncounted amid speculation of a pre-election postal strike. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":302,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[12],"cc_featured_image_caption":{"caption_text":"","source_text":"","source_url":""},"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/post-box-2691454_1920.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&ssl=1","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 -
