This policy\nalso explicitly covers the use of first-class rail travel. The expenses policy\nfor Durham University, which was last updated this October states that the\nUniversity will only accept expenses for First class rail travel in three\ninstances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, if there is a compelling and evidenced case of disability, impairment or health-related need. As far as the Monocle knows this condition does not apply to any members of the senior staff and is not stated in any expenses claims which were reviewed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, if there is a \u201cCompelling value-for-money case\u201d. It is far from clear what this actually means given that in almost all situations a standard class ticket will offer greater value for money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cases reviewed include instances of last-minute ticket\npurchases because of academic conferences &#8220;overrunning&#8221;. In one\ninstance a senior manager spent over \u00a3500 on one return trip from Durham to London,\nincluding underground fares. Another senior manager, claimed \u00a3129 for a return\nrail trip from Durham to London Kings Cross for the 28<sup>th<\/sup> of January.\nWhen this meeting had to be extended the manager then claimed another \u00a3174 for\na first-class trip departing the following day. A different manager followed in\nsimilar fashion, as he claimed \u00a3168.65 for a return trip from Darlington to\nKing\u2019s Cross for the Office for Students conference in London. However, when\nthe conference overran, the academic claimed an extra \u00a372.95 for another\nfirst-class trip back to Darlington <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third and final exception from the prohibition of excessively expensive train travel is the case of \u201cExceptional operational need\u201d. Given that the operational need would seem to be to get from A to B as swiftly and as conveniently as possible, it is hard to see how such a basis could legitimately support first class instead of standard class travel, unless, say, only first class travel was available. In order to qualify for this the Expenses and Hospitality Policy stipulates that approval needs to be sought in advance from the relevant University Executive Committee member and attached when claiming the expense, presumably this is done to deter the abuse of expenses claims.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, each expenses claim &nbsp;investigated by the Monocle is from a member &nbsp;of the University Executive Committee and so it is entirely unclear how the requirement for advance approval operates as a meaningful check&nbsp; as the \u201crelevant University Executive Committee member\u201d would be themselves. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One committee member appears to have claimed some \u00a31703 in only three months. Another claimed for \u00a0the cost of a first-class trip from Darlington to Newcastle, a half an hour train. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Monocle Exclusive: The Monocle can reveal that Senior Managers at Durham last year claimed cumulatively \u00a312,366 on First Class Trains<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":179,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[2],"tags":[11],"cc_featured_image_caption":{"caption_text":"","source_text":"Image by Larisa Koshkina from Pixabay","source_url":"https:\/\/pixabay.com\/users\/Larisa-K-1107275\/?utm_source=link-attribution&#038;utm_medium=referral&#038;utm_campaign=image&#038;utm_content=163518"},"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/railroad-tracks-163518_1280.jpg?fit=1280%2C827&ssl=1","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 -
