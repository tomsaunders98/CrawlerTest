Mummy drove me to the station in the old defender on her way to work, but don\u2019t worry about that, it\u2019s big businesses that need to change. As I sat on the train brimming with excitement for the day ahead, I bumped into none other than Tarquin and Mungo sitting with their XR banners and, of course, reusable bottles at hand (so woke) and compared carbon footprints after a summer of travelling across South America. As we got into London it was straight to \u2018Itsu\u2019 for me where I stocked up on my daily dose of single use plastic which I later ditched somewhere in St James\u2019 Park to be choked on by a pelican. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">When I had finally found the rest of the protestors, my brothers and sisters in arms, the buzz was palpable. We were left wondering if there was to be another surprise appearance from some B-List celebrity who had flown in from California for the occasion. Again, it\u2019s up to big business to change their habits, not us, we\u2019re the solution. After a good photo shoot in front of the Cenotaph and a bit of playful desecration of the war memorial the day of protesting was well on its way.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Later on, we bumped into a stand handing out warm food for us hardened protestors who were in dire need of rations, I hadn\u2019t eaten for hours and the abuse we were getting from the police was really awful. We must be the most poorly treated group of protestors in the world right now (sorry Hong Kong). On my way back to the train station I passed a group of XR activists blocking the road and wistfully thought to myself what a marvellous job they were doing, if we keep going like this the British public will be on our side in no time!  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Conor Johnson discusses the hypocrisy rife at the &#8216;Autumn Uprising&#8217;. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":70,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[7],"cc_featured_image_caption":{"caption_text":"","source_text":"\"London 16 April 2019 017\" by paul_appleyard","source_url":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/20342758@N00"},"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/XR-.jpg?fit=1024%2C565&ssl=1","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 -
