James suggested Morey was \u2018uninformed\u2019 about the situation arising in the region, suggesting it would have been wiser for him to stay quiet.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The star basketball player is perhaps wise to steer clear of criticising China. China has invested hugely into the NBA, and have been key to the financial growth of the NBA, making it particularly alarming that following the controversial tweet many Chinese companies immediately cut ties with the organisation. It seems then that James has an invested interest in keeping China cosy, as not only are they both capable of great leaps forward, China also pays his wages. He pleaded for people to consider what they tweet in the future about such sensitive topics, showing concern for what could harm people physically, emotionally, spiritually, but most importantly it seems, financially.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Some may be surprised to hear that basketball has been incredibly popular in China for over a century. Christian missionaries, while failing to bring Christianity, were successful in bringing the sport to the East. Mao Zedong proved to be a huge fan, leading it to become so popular during the cultural revolution that it and ping pong became the only two acceptable sports to play. The communist party lauded the sports ability to boost camaraderie and solidarity among their troops, something apparently literally no other sport could do. It is even reported that The People\u2019s Liberation Army began to play basketball in internal organised leagues, offering high military ranks and luxurious lifestyles to star players, something which no doubt was essential to achieving the camaraderie they hoped to achieve.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">James, despite not being keen on speaking out against China, has gained a reputation of being consistently outspoken on controversial issues in his own country. He showed solidarity with Colin Kaepernick and the Black Lives Matter movement, and has a history of criticising the Trump administration.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">High profile politicians and public figures have condemned James\u2019s comments and lack of support for Morey and Hong Kong. This included Ted Cruz, who was furious when James spoke out in support of American civil rights, but was equally irate that James had not spoken in support of Chinese civil rights.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In fairness the timing of Morey\u2019s tweet was spectacularly poor, as James\u2019 Lakers arrived in China for a series of pre season games the day after the tweet. With his hands tied, the decision to suggest Morey was \u2018uninformed\u2019 may have been a necessary diplomatic move to keep the peace for a week, something James\u2019 president has struggled to manage in his tenure.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">All this played out in the backdrop of an ongoing trade war between the US and China, which both sides are reluctant to budge on. The growing tension in the international sphere between the US, China, and Hong Kong has been a sobering remainder for the NBA of the political cost of Chinese investment, even for an organisation priding itself on its members ability to engage in free speech and activism.<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ben Sampson discusses the criticism LeBron James has received for his lack of support for Hong Kong.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":119,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[4],"tags":[8],"cc_featured_image_caption":{"caption_text":"","source_text":"Tim Shelby -
