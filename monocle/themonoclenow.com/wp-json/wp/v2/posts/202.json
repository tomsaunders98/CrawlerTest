This can be seen through not only the huge increase in commemorative t-shirts, but also in the number of grown men genuinely having Jordan Henderson as their Facebook profile picture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Anti-Liverpool protesters have argued that the government\u2019s large-scale purchase of beachballs is not enough to counter the threat, and many vow to continue their campaign until Howard Webb is brought out of retirement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;This week, MPs are expected to approve legislation that would grant Demba Ba sweeping powers to play against Liverpool each week. A similar bill that would safeguard Dejan Lovren\u2019s place in the starting line-up will also be debated in the Chamber.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fringes of the movement, conspiracy theorists are trying to ascertain the nature of the link between Liverpool\u2019s good fortune and Brexit. The common consensus is that Britain leaving the EU is a distraction from the real issue of Adam Lallana potentially winning a Premier League medal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;However, a growing number believe Brexit to be an elaborately orchestrated taster of the relentless banging on about the same thing that would follow any Liverpool title win.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;One of the most controversial aspects of the debate centres around past instances of possible collusion between influential Liverpool players and the state. Numerous sources claim Steven Gerrard and Loris Karius to have been double agents working in the national interest by making mistakes at key moments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;A similar charge levelled against Alberto Moreno was dropped upon the discovery that he really was trying his best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The anonymous activist warned: \u201cIt\u2019s time the government started focusing on the real issues-not hard borders and climate disasters, or whatever it is they\u2019re always on about. If not, what sort of society are we leaving to future generations?&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;This means more to me than Brexit&#8221;- Jeremy Corbyn (probably)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":9,"featured_media":214,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[4],"tags":[14],"cc_featured_image_caption":{"caption_text":"","source_text":"\"Harry Enfield Scousers in Liverpoool\" by dullhunk is licensed under CC BY 2.0 ","source_url":"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/14829735@N00\/352840552"},"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/352840552_7a9a0a6ec7.jpg?fit=500%2C317&ssl=1","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 -
