Nonetheless, the Queen did a stand-up job at acting like someone who has genuine belief in the current crop of politicians at the top of the Tory party, reminding viewers of the best that this country has to offer. Charles at her side, on the other hand, acted as a reminder that once Queen Elizabeth is gone, so too will be her brand of expert professionalism and diplomacy. Some more discerning readers may have noticed, as every other news outlet has done, that the Queen opted for a slightly more relaxed look this afternoon, donning the state diadem, rather than the state crown, while she delivered Boris Johnson\u2019s plans for this session of parliament. Whether this was a subtle dig at Bozza or merely a necessity for an elderly lady with a weaker neck than it once was is open for debate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The speech itself touched on all manner of things that Boris and co plan on achieving in parliament, but with the majority (or lack thereof) that Boris commands it is unlikely any of these pledges will actually be achieved anytime soon, causing many to dismiss the speech as an election manifesto rather than a reasonable plan of action. In this sense it is rather uncomfortable seeing the Queen, who is obliged to attend events such as these, being used in what was effectively a glorified launch of an election campaign. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The first line alone\noutlines what most believe to be a completely unachievable goal; to leave the\nEuropean Union on the 31<sup>st<\/sup> of October. If Boris could manage to convince\nthe other 27 member states of the EU of his nationalist plan to depart from everyone\u2019s\nfavourite project of abolishing the nation state under the guise of economic\nprosperity, then hats off to him. &nbsp;Meanwhile,\nin the real world, Boris continues to make enemies everywhere he goes, and his\ndeal looks no more likely to be approved than Dominic Cummings being recruited\nto stand for the Liberal Democrats. With \u2018No Deal\u2019 widely accepted to be off\nthe cards, in part due to the \u2018Surrender\/Benn Act\u2019 (delete where appropriate)\nit looks as though the main policy that Her Majesty\u2019s government is committed\nto is an unachievable one. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The rest of the Queen\u2019s\nspeech outlines a new vision for the United Kingdom outside of the European\nUnion. Policies on fisheries, trade and agriculture mark the departure from the\nsingle market and a new immigration bill to end free movement shows a commitment\nto change following Britain\u2019s (eventual) exit from the European Union. The speech\nmentions everything from tougher criminal sentences for those convicted of the\nmost serious crimes to cameos from Carrie Symond\u2019s own playbook such as a new\nbill promising tougher sentences for animal abuse. All in all, it looks like\nour prisons will be nice and busy by Christmas. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">More progressivism can be\nseen with the Environment Bill enshrining, for the first time, environmental\nprotection in law \u2013 that\u2019s one for the crusties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This speech then, while acting\nas a list of unachievable pledges given the current parliamentary composition, is\nnot overly revelatory. That Boris plans on being tough on crime yet fairer on\nthe NHS come as no surprise after the announcements he has made in the last few\nweeks. Boris told the commons that he plans on governing as a One Nation Tory,\nand if he can get the Queen\u2019s speech approved by parliament then maybe he will.\nHowever, with that prospect looking ever unlikely we may have to wait a bit\nlonger before Johnson gets the chance to enact his vision on our country.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our take on the Queen&#8217;s Speech.
