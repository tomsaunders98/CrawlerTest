They released the\nframework as \u201cOpen Source\u201d, meaning that the framework was not only free to\nuse, but the underlying code was available for anyone to learn from it, adapt\nit or copy it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The framework enjoyed lasting popularity; its successor,\nPyTorch, is used by Facebook and the lead developer of the framework, Samy\nBengio, is now a research scientist at Google. Mr Bengio explained that when\nhis team released Torch: \u201cwe were in a very academic environment, so open\nsourcing seemed totally legitimate and useful for reproducibility.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Open Source model has been a key part of the academic\ncommunity for a long time. In 2001, 40 members of the editorial board of the\nArtificial Intelligence journal Machine Learning resigned, explaining that in\nthe era of the Internet it was wrong for researchers to publish their findings\nin expensive pay-access archives. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This mindset has found its way into big technology firms who\nare desperate to hire leading academics in the field of Artificial\nIntelligence: \u201cPublishing and open-sourcing are both part of a healthy\nscientific community\u201d added Mr Bengio, \u201cGood researchers in our field know\nthat, and they also know that they can somehow choose their employer more than\ntheir employer can choose them.\u201d The list of companies that have embraced the\nOpen Source movement in relation to Artificial Intelligence reads like a Who\u2019s\nWho of the Tech World, Google, Intel, Facebook, Uber, Lyft, Microsoft and even\nDARPA have contributed to the dizzying quantity of freely available AI tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Academics have been able to keep AI a largely open research\narea because they see the Open Source model as a way to ensure that the field\nmoves as quickly as possible; that academics are able to build on each other\u2019s\nwork as quickly and efficiently as possible. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are risks. The implications of AI advancements\nhave potentially world-shattering consequences. AI, Mr Bengio acknowledged,\n\u201ccould also help bad actors build problematic tools that could be used to harm\nsociety. Think for instance about face recognition technology used by rogue\ngovernments.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, it seems that this worst-case scenario has\nalready become a reality. Last week, it was reported that Mr Ton-That, a\ncollege drop out and one-time model, used freely available academic papers and\nopen sourced AI products to perfect a Facial Recognition algorithm. It was used\nin concert with billions of photos scraped from social networks to create a\nprogram that can be used to identify anyone from one single photo. His company,\nClearview, has licensed his product out to Police departments across the United\nStates. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google and Microsoft both refrained from open sourcing their\nfacial recognition algorithms for fear of this very thing happening. However,\nthe overwhelming quantity of freely available products and expertise meant that\ntheir efforts were ultimately in vain. It\u2019s unclear whether the open source\nmovement will continue in the same vain but whether it does is unlikely to\naffect AI in the near future. Even products such as Google\u2019s AI text-to-speech\ngenerator, which was debuted to much fanfare in 2018 at Google\u2019s annual\nconference, has been recreated in open source by programmers even though the\nreal thing remains propriety.\n\nWhat this means for the tech world is unclear,\nbut its consequences could be dire. Hackers have already used AI to impersonate\nthe CEO of a U.K.-based energy firm, running away with \u20ac220,000. When asked\nabout whether large technology firms will be as committed to open source in AI\nas they are now, Mr Bengio replied: \u201cI&#8217;m not really good at reading the future\n:-).\u201d\n\n\n\n<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Monocle speaks to one of  the foremost experts in AI on the &#8220;open source&#8221;
