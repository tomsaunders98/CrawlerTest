But implementing the plan has proven to be incredibly difficult, with a number of loopholes showing how easily could be sidestepped. The Guardian reported in April how one proposed verification system could be bypassed in a matter of minutes, which is pretty impressive for a lonely employee on their lunch break.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Confusion also surrounds the fine print of the proposals. A site must comply if advertised as a pornographic website, or if one third of their content is pornographic. It is unclear what is being measured if by a third it is supposed to be images, or text or something else. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also unclear on how we classify an image as pornographic, where do we draw the line as to where a  revealing picture becomes pornographic? Some may argue the more saucy renaissance paintings could fall under the category or porn if showing images of nude women, but surely we should not suggest age limits to view this content in national art galleries.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The verification also covers audio porn, a genre becoming increasingly popular among the visually impaired. But there is no such ban on written work, only on audio visual content. So it seems one can write anything as explicit as they want, but God forbid someone were to read this out and post the audio online, showing some bizzare favouritism to the deaf over the blind.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also privacy concerns over the collection of personal information that could be hacked to reveal potentially embarrassing personal habits of individuals. Something similar happened after the infidelity website Ashely Madison was hacked in 2015 implicating a large number of Australian government officials, but I\u2019m sure British members of parliament would have nothing to worry about.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The social media site Tumblr blocked any NSFW content on their platform for similar concerns, and saw a fifth of their users abandon them in the first 3 months following the ban according to the independent. A petition reaching 600,000 signatures argued that the pornographic content was 90% of the reason anyone used the site anyway.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems though, at least for the foreseeable future, the UK will not see an age restriction on it\u2019s adult content sites, and we will not see 18 years olds gleefully head down to the post office on their birthdays to purchase their \u2018porn pass\u2019. <br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A look at the governments decision to abandon age verification for access to adult content websites.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":161,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[8],"cc_featured_image_caption":{"caption_text":"\"buckup\" by jim68000 is licensed under CC BY 2.0 ","source_text":"","source_url":""},"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/blocked-by-gov.jpg?fit=1024%2C847&ssl=1","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 -
