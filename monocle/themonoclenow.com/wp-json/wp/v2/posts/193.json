This reluctance to pursue criminal reports is understandable since a criminal trial l can be an immense emotional strain on a victim of sexual misconduct or violence. Not to mention that the high burden of proof (&#8220;beyond reasonable doubt&#8221;) makes securing a conviction &nbsp;difficult. Of the cases reported to the police where Durham was informed of the status of the criminal proceedings 75% had ended in No Further Action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second option available to students is to\nreport the incident to the University. This is the option that victims who wish\nto report usually take. Furthermore, since the standard of proof is not the\nsame as the legal standard it is generally a more approachable option. The\nUniversity even states within its guidance on reporting sexual assault that a\ndecision by the Police or Crown Prosecution Service to take no further action\nin relation to a criminal matter or an acquittal at a trial does not preclude\nthe University from taking action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is a significant flaw within the University\u2019s procedure of dealing with sexual assault cases. Students who want to avoid punishment simply have to leave the University and it seems that a shockingly high number of students have been doing just that. Even more concerning is the fact that it is primarily only those students that are accused of the most serious offences which cause students to leave the University, escaping any form of punishment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, in the most serious cases of Sexual Assault at Durham University, also known as \u201cCategory 2\u201d offences, the perpetrator is referred to the Senate Discipline Committee. These offences consist of the most serious in the opinion of Durham such as rape, abusive sexual behaviour and recording without consent. However, the University has disclosed that between 2014 and December of 2018, 44% of those who referred to the Senate Discipline Committee instead withdrew from the University before the hearing could be held. In these cases, the victim will have no other outcome since the University will drop the disciplinary proceedings if the Accused Party withdraws. At the same time, the perpetrator can presumably enroll at a different university with a relatively unblemished record.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The University also disclosed in their report that \u201cthis is a trend that has been highlighted at conferences across the sector in the last year\u201d. However, after The Monocle sent Freedom of Information to every Russel Group university, we can reveal that of all the Universities that responded, Durham had by far the highest rate of students leaving before the end of a university investigation. Birmingham, Cardiff, Belfast did not reply with a sufficient answer and UCL Warwick and Bristol either did not reply at all or did so in an untimely manner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The University was asked to comment by the\nMonocle but did not respond in a timely manner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A monocle investigation into sexual misconduct cases at Durham University can reveal that between 2014 and December of 2018, 44% of Accused Parties in cases of sexual misconduct or violence left the University before their hearing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":194,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[2],"tags":[11],"cc_featured_image_caption":{"caption_text":"","source_text":"\"Durham Cathedral\" by timrawle is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0","source_url":"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/7811565@N03\/2336846189"},"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/cath123.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&ssl=1","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 -
