Still up in arms about the introduction of equal marriage and reproductive rights, expect them to make the most of their final gasp of relevance on a UK-wide level. Quite impressive in that each of their MPs manages to be individually dislikeable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sinn F\u00e9in:&nbsp;<\/strong>The abstentionist republicans have made a strong start to their campaign to out-twat the DUP by having  IRA bomber and convicted mass murderer Sean Kelly canvass for one of their candidates. A further slip of the mask of inclusiveness came when their Queen\u2019s University society displayed a \u2018Brits Out\u2019 banner during their Fresher\u2019s Fair. But you can\u2019t be wrong if you\u2019re always the victim, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ulster Unionist Party:&nbsp;<\/strong>The more moderate unionist party\u2019s incoming party leader Steve Aiken vowed to stand up to the DUP, and then immediately backtracked on a promise to field a candidate in every constituency to avoid splitting the unionist vote in North Belfast. That\u2019ll show \u2018em you\u2019re not just a doormat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Social Democratic Labour Party:&nbsp;<\/strong>Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s more vanilla cousins are seeking to claw back moderate nationalist votes. As with the UUP, they\u2019ve been steadily losing votes to the hardliners in recent years. You\u2019d almost feel sorry for them if they weren\u2019t so incredibly dull.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alliance Party:&nbsp;<\/strong>This liberal, non-sectarian party has long been the subject of scorn for its attempts to see past the religious divide. How dare they try to build a better future? The political equivalent of a plain ham sandwich and ready salted crisps meal deal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"> <strong>And the Rest<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Traditional Unionist Voice:&nbsp;<\/strong>Yes, this pro-Union party manages to make the DUP look a bit tame. Essentially the one-man-band of ex-DUP grandee Jim Allister, it remains to be seen whether they\u2019ll bother standing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Green Party:<\/strong>They\u2019re basically a Prius-driving Alliance Party but with an even more self-congratulatory support base. You can be sure all five of their voters will be sobbing over their quinoa when they don\u2019t win any seats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aont\u00fa:&nbsp;<\/strong>This new all-Ireland party is the brainchild of republicans impressed by the DUP\u2019s example of turning the Old Testament into a political manifesto.&nbsp;The name means (*checks notes*) \u2018unity\u2019, which seems apt considering how they\u2019ve managed to unite all the bad points of the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in into one political abomination.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>People Before Profit:&nbsp;<\/strong>As the name suggests, they\u2019re not big on the whole capitalism thing. It must be hard to start a revolution when nobody knows who you are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NI Conservatives:&nbsp;<\/strong>So irrelevant that Boris Johnson probably doesn\u2019t know they exist. Essentially the San Marino football team of the political scene, you have them some credit for persisting even whilst getting decimated in every election.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>David Balmer gives a pre-Election lowdown<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":9,"featured_media":290,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[14],"cc_featured_image_caption":{"caption_text":"","source_text":"\"Stormont\" by Bearfaced is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 ","source_url":""},"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/248292666_a14bfe2dfa_o.jpg?fit=800%2C533&ssl=1","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 -
