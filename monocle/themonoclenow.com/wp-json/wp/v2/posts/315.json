Geographically they may be far away. However, they have ignited\nprotest organically in universities across the globe from Brisbane to Bristol.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just recently a total of 78 Hong Kong-affiliated student\ngroups from across the globe released a <em>Joint Statement on Police Brutality\nand Academic Freedom<\/em>. The full list of signatories includes groups in the\nNetherlands, Los Angeles, New Zealand and of course Durham.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the Monocle we sat down with members of the Durham Hong Kong protests to understand how this international phenomenon arose and what it is all about. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1300\" height=\"975\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/pic-5-done.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-330\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/pic-5-done.jpg?w=1300&amp;ssl=1 1300w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/pic-5-done.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/pic-5-done.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/pic-5-done.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h1>How the protests came about<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The organisers were initially very clear to emphasise that\nthere was no central chain of command linking these protest groups from across\nthe world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not centralised at all, it\u2019s very similar to the movement itself back home, there is no central platform, it is all people coming out and saying: we don\u2019t want this.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decentralisation of the movement is more than merely circumstantial,\nin many ways it seems to be what has made them so incredibly effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen I have signed up to be a helper in a London protest, I am not notified about anything until last minute and everything still works out fine. I think this not only represents how the leaderless thing works, but how it has become the characteristic of HK people all over the world.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt shows that not everything is centralised, and everyone has their own say in the whole movement as well.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Dealing with counter-protests<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The protests have been met with some opposition and there\nhave been some incidents in which Hong Kong protesters have come into contact\nwith counter-protesters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The protesters mentioned an incident which took place at Sheffield University where one man was arrested in a counter-protest under suspicion of committing a public order offence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this interview took place, there was a counter\ndemonstration by Chinese supporters to the Hong Kong protesters. The atmosphere\nwas tense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe know there are risks of counter protesters, but we believe dialogue is the most important thing. The fact we are lucky enough to study at university and have this opportunity whereas a lot of places around the world don\u2019t have this space for dialogue. Therefore, it is important to talk to as many people as possible even though we know they have different preconceptions of our movement.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1243\" height=\"932\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/pic-3-another.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-329\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/pic-3-another.jpg?w=1243&amp;ssl=1 1243w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/pic-3-another.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/pic-3-another.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/pic-3-another.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h1>What is it like in Hong Kong?<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst English universities have supported the Hong Kong protestors&#8217; right to free speech, and Durham is no exception, the reality in Hong Kong as most know is very different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOften the running joke is, because many of the people in the protests are quite young, often secondary school students, and the skill which they\u2019ve learnt over the summer is the ability to diffuse teargas in a few seconds. That\u2019s not the experience some of us have but it\u2019s the idea that you will be affected by teargas one way or the other. You can be coming off work, or having a meal with somebody, and you\u2019ll see teargas going off somewhere.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s something ridiculous like 80% of all HK people have been affected by teargas.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio wp-embed-aspect-16-9\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"831 \u592a\u5b50\u7ad9 \u7121\u5dee\u5225\u8972\u64ca\u5168\u76f4\u64ca\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/q7syFRh4a4A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption>August 31 inside a train<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h1>What do they want?<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Often people assume that what the Hong Kong protests are all about is independence from China, but the people we talked to were all quick to emphasise that this is far from their main goal<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe line of argument often going against the Hong Kong movement is that HK is trying to get away from China, it\u2019s a territorial dispute, but no this is absolutely not what we are trying to do.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, what unites the protests all around the world as\nwell as Hong Kong are five relatively simple demands:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Formal withdrawal of the extradition bill.<\/li><li>Exoneration and release of arrested protesters.<\/li><li>Independent commission and enquiry into police brutality .<\/li><li>The government to withdraw the use of the word \u201criot\u201d in relation to protests.<\/li><li>Implementation of genuine universal suffrage.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, it seems that the protests in Durham and around\nthe world are about exercising their respective right to free speech in support\nof those whose right is under threat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cUniversity is and should be a place of freedom of speech and expression it is a very good place to show what this is about and show that in fact free speech and expression isn\u2019t always the case around the world nowadays as we see in Hong Kong.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Monocle sits down with participants in the Hong Kong protests in Durham.
