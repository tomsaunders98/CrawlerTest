The firm provided significant assistance in areas such as design and architecture. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The firm have already shown their 40 years experience in working with these complex scientific constructions, having been involved with the relocation of a locust house at Newcastle University, meaning they were well placed when it came to competing for the mosquito laboratory and Laboratory 5. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The construction of the 100 metres squared Laboratory 5, and 23 metres squared Mosquito Laboratory was facilitated through partnership with JH &amp; Partners and building was concluded ready for the 2019\/20 academic year. The Mosquito Laboratory contains specialist incubators to house the mosquitos, with special structures put in place to ensure their safe keeping. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Durham University hope to support their research staff through promoting invertebrate research and developing appropriately modern facilities. This helps to ensures that research concerning genetic modification of various species (including fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster, mosquitoes and nematodes C.elegans, is made possible. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Professor Steve Lindsay, a world-leading expert on Malaria, along\nwith researchers at Durham University and worldwide, have been working for the\nlast 30 years trying to discover ways to not only treat the disease, but\nprevent and control its spread. &nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Charlotte Evans discusses one of Durham University&#8217;s smallest buildings.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":201,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[2],"tags":[12],"cc_featured_image_caption":{"caption_text":"","source_text":"","source_url":""},"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/dna-3539309_1920.jpg?fit=1920%2C960&ssl=1","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 -
