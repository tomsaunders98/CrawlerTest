<p>Juan Martinez, a Postgraduate student at Grey College, has been imprisoned for 18 months after ransacking rooms over the Christmas holidays.</p>



<p>Martinez, originally from Mexico, broke into a room where he stole two laptops, electrical items, jewellery and other personal items. He also stole 46 letters from the college post room.</p>



<p>Martinez was eventually caught in a female toilet block in the college on the 5<sup>th</sup> of January. However, this did little to deter him as he returned on 21<sup>st</sup> of January to steal a door lock and “numerous letters”.</p>



<p>He then returned on January 23<sup>rd</sup> to burgle the college again, armed with a knife.</p>



<p>On the 7<sup>th</sup> of July he was sentenced to 18 months in prison for three counts of burglary and one count of going equipped to burgle.</p>



<p>Honorary Recorder of Durham James Adkin stated: “I have heard that you are a man of good character and appear to be intelligent and graduated from Durham University.</p>



<p>I am not entirely sure what motivated you to commit these offences. Only a custodial sentence can be justified.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hundreds of students and Durhm locals turned out for the Black Lives Matter protest in Durham today. The peaceful protest began at Palace Green where protesters took a knee in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>



<p>Around 450 protests met in Palace Green, many with placards with slogans such as “the UK is not innocent” and “silence is violence”.</p>



<p>Counter-protesters assembled in market square, claiming that they were to “protect” Durham market square from vandalism.  </p>



<p>However, according to eye-witnesses, the counter-protesters attempted to disrupt the protests multiple times at both Milburngate and Claypath.</p>



<p>In any event, the BLM protest was entirely peaceful and by all accounts a successful show of solidarity with the wider BLM movement.</p>



<p>Jerome Yates, one of the organisers of the event, stated “I was over the moon with the turnout, which was amazing give the event was only officially created on Thursday.”</p>



<p>He added that “we wanted to show solidarity with the protests taking place across America and the UK today and to stress the need to change and action, especially with regards to education of injustices, biases and micro-aggressions that hurt People of Colour every single day.”</p>

<p>Durham University will scrap face to face teaching next week and students will be free, if they chose to, to go home early.</p>



<p>In an email to students this afternoon , the University stated that: &#8220;We will make every effort to ensure that all of you can participate in classes remotely until the Easter break. </p>



<p>You will also be able to access online materials over the Easter break for revision purposes.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Library will remain open until the end of term.</p>



<p>College accomodation will also operate as normal next week.</p>



<p>It is unclear at the moment if students will return to Durham in the final term. </p>



<p>There have been a total of twelve cases of Coronavirus in the North East. </p>



<p>Health officials confirmed the first case in County Durham on Tuesday in Darlington.</p>



<p>England&#8217;s deputy chief medical officer recently stated the peak coronavirus epidemic in the UK is expected within the next fortnight. At the time of writing, cases have risen to a total of 456 with eight deaths so far.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At Durham University Library, Hong Kong protesters stand in
a phalanx in silence, black masks over their faces, large cardboard posters in
their hands. Students, typically, take no notice. They walk past, generally
supportive but ultimately uninterested. However, today is different; opposite
the protesters stand a small group of pro-mainland students holding Chinese
flags. No words are spoken, but the air fills with a tentative silence. Other
students watch on, some in apprehension, others in fascination. The world has
come to Durham.</p>



<p>At the grassroot level, these pro-democracy confrontations
have spread rapidly across nations that have stayed studiously silent on the
protests. In small university towns, thousands of miles from China,
pro-democracy protesters are clashing with supporters of Xi Jinping’s
government, sometimes violently. Durham, with a population of less than 50,000,
is one of these small cities. With perpetual grey skies and more pubs than Uber
drivers, Durham has never been an international or multicultural city. However,
as in most university towns across the West, this is changing.</p>



<p>Data from the Higher Education Statistics Authority shows
that the number of Chinese students at Durham has increased by over 30% in the
last four years and they now make up almost ten per cent of the university
population. This trend is replicated across the UK: according to HESA, last
year 31% of international students across the UK were from China. This trend
has transformed these Hong Kong protests from staid, often sparsely attended
student rallies, into dangerous and potentially violent confrontations. In
Sheffield one student was arrested after a confrontation, in Queensland,
Australia, students have received death threats from counter-protesters.</p>



<p>Often these confrontations are less about calls for
democracy in Hong Kong than they are about identity. As one protest leader in
Durham explained: “in order to differentiate themselves they try to build up
this HK identity, and this whole prejudice is emerging.” These identities,
built on nationalism, have served to inhibit dialogue and entrench positions on
both sides. </p>



<p>However, the battle-lines are not as neatly drawn as people
may think. “Talking to a lot of people helps break down the stereotype of
Chinese people as embracing the communist party” one Hong Kong protester added.
“I’ve met loads of people with different opinions on the Chinese government”.
Often Chinese students are reticent to state their opinions in public, mindful
of the dangers, fearful of whom they can trust. One student protester explained
that he knew many mainland Chinese who were critical of their government but as
he put it mildly, they “would be a bit wary” of voicing those beliefs.</p>



<p>As is often the case, dialogue between the groups, both formal
and informal, has engendered understanding and amongst some, acceptance. As one
Hong Kong protester reflected: “So I think a lot of people were wary of us, but
through talking we have managed to convince a few that our objectives are
peaceful … even to Chinese people we shouldn’t be seen as enemies.”</p>

<p>Lilian
Groves knows Durham. She was an undergraduate at the university, then a
lecturer and eventually the Vice Principal of Hilde-Bede college. Three weeks after
retiring she became a tour-guide for Durham Cathedral and 20 years later, at
the age of 91, she is still there.</p>



<p>Thinking
about her proudest moment she told me, full of modesty, “I suppose it was being
chosen as what was that called? Visit England Superstar. That was probably it.”</p>



<p>In
fact, in 2016 she won Durham Tourism Superstar and later in the same year the
national equivalent, Visit England Superstar. However, according to Lilian “it
was the lead up to it that was amazing as anything else. One of the cannons in
the cathedral wrote a song which the choristers sang, and it went viral.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ever
modest, she assured me all she had won was “a hideous plaque and a huge framed
certificate which is sitting on the floor in my study.”</p>



<p>When I
asked her who her favourite visitor was, she replied cautiously: “It’s hard to
say. I’ve taken Sting who told me that he wanted to adopt me as his mother.
I’ve taken Princess Anne, she was terrific fun, marvellous sense of humour.”</p>



<p>However,
her favourite was a local woman from Sunderland. Lilian explained that “she
came on a public tour and at the end of the tour she crossed my hands and said,
‘flower I wouldn’t have missed that for a million pounds.’ And I thought that
was brilliant, absolutely brilliant.”</p>

<p>The Monocle sits down with participants in the Hong Kong protests in Durham. </p>



<p>The protests in Hong Kong have been unlike any other in
recent memory. Geographically they may be far away. However, they have ignited
protest organically in universities across the globe from Brisbane to Bristol.</p>



<p>Just recently a total of 78 Hong Kong-affiliated student
groups from across the globe released a <em>Joint Statement on Police Brutality
and Academic Freedom</em>. The full list of signatories includes groups in the
Netherlands, Los Angeles, New Zealand and of course Durham.</p>



<p>At the Monocle we sat down with members of the Durham Hong Kong protests to understand how this international phenomenon arose and what it is all about. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1300" height="975" src="https://i0.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-5-done.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-330" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-5-done.jpg?w=1300&amp;ssl=1 1300w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-5-done.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-5-done.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-5-done.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<h1>How the protests came about</h1>



<p>The organisers were initially very clear to emphasise that
there was no central chain of command linking these protest groups from across
the world.</p>



<p>“It’s not centralised at all, it’s very similar to the movement itself back home, there is no central platform, it is all people coming out and saying: we don’t want this.”</p>



<p>The decentralisation of the movement is more than merely circumstantial,
in many ways it seems to be what has made them so incredibly effective.</p>



<p>“When I have signed up to be a helper in a London protest, I am not notified about anything until last minute and everything still works out fine. I think this not only represents how the leaderless thing works, but how it has become the characteristic of HK people all over the world.”</p>



<p>“It shows that not everything is centralised, and everyone has their own say in the whole movement as well.”</p>



<h1>Dealing with counter-protests</h1>



<p>The protests have been met with some opposition and there
have been some incidents in which Hong Kong protesters have come into contact
with counter-protesters.</p>



<p>The protesters mentioned an incident which took place at Sheffield University where one man was arrested in a counter-protest under suspicion of committing a public order offence.</p>



<p>After this interview took place, there was a counter
demonstration by Chinese supporters to the Hong Kong protesters. The atmosphere
was tense.</p>



<p>“We know there are risks of counter protesters, but we believe dialogue is the most important thing. The fact we are lucky enough to study at university and have this opportunity whereas a lot of places around the world don’t have this space for dialogue. Therefore, it is important to talk to as many people as possible even though we know they have different preconceptions of our movement.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1243" height="932" src="https://i0.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-3-another.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-329" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-3-another.jpg?w=1243&amp;ssl=1 1243w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-3-another.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-3-another.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-3-another.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<h1>What is it like in Hong Kong?</h1>



<p>Whilst English universities have supported the Hong Kong protestors&#8217; right to free speech, and Durham is no exception, the reality in Hong Kong as most know is very different.</p>



<p>“Often the running joke is, because many of the people in the protests are quite young, often secondary school students, and the skill which they’ve learnt over the summer is the ability to diffuse teargas in a few seconds. That’s not the experience some of us have but it’s the idea that you will be affected by teargas one way or the other. You can be coming off work, or having a meal with somebody, and you’ll see teargas going off somewhere.”</p>



<p>“It’s something ridiculous like 80% of all HK people have been affected by teargas.”</p>

</div><figcaption>August 31 inside a train</figcaption></figure>



<h1>What do they want?</h1>



<p>Often people assume that what the Hong Kong protests are all about is independence from China, but the people we talked to were all quick to emphasise that this is far from their main goal</p>



<p>“The line of argument often going against the Hong Kong movement is that HK is trying to get away from China, it’s a territorial dispute, but no this is absolutely not what we are trying to do.”</p>



<p>In fact, what unites the protests all around the world as
well as Hong Kong are five relatively simple demands:</p>



<ol><li>Formal withdrawal of the extradition bill.</li><li>Exoneration and release of arrested protesters.</li><li>Independent commission and enquiry into police brutality .</li><li>The government to withdraw the use of the word “riot” in relation to protests.</li><li>Implementation of genuine universal suffrage.</li></ol>



<p>Ultimately, it seems that the protests in Durham and around
the world are about exercising their respective right to free speech in support
of those whose right is under threat.</p>



<p>“University is and should be a place of freedom of speech and expression it is a very good place to show what this is about and show that in fact free speech and expression isn’t always the case around the world nowadays as we see in Hong Kong.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>79% of UCU members voted in favour of strike action in the
ballot over changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS). These
changes would have led to UCU members being approximately £240,000 worse off
due to changes in the pension scheme.</p>



<p>The results of the vote were first reported by the UCU on
the 31<sup>st</sup> of October. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The UCU of Durham also backed strike action due to pay
casualisation, equality and workloads. A recent report by the Universities and Colleges
Employers Association UCEA showed that pay for university staff has dropped by
around 17% in real terms since 2009.</p>



<p>Last year university campuses including Durham were brought
to a standstill over the USS pension scheme. </p>



<p>The UCU general secretary Jo Grady said: “&#8217;It is incredibly
frustrating that we had to ballot members again, but universities only have
themselves to blame after failing to address falling real-terms pay and for
refusing to deal with casualisation, workloads and the rising cost of USS
pensions.”</p>



<p>The strike action has been received positively by most Student Unions. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner called on both sides to get around the table for urgent talks and said that she fully supported UCU members fighting for fair pay and decent pensions.</p>



<p>The Durham Student Union President Kate McIntosh stated on twitter, that she was unequivocally in support of the strike but that strike action must be member-led.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m unequivical in my support for the right to strike &#8211; I know students really  care about fair pay &amp; pensions for uni staff. That said, strike action must be member-led. We should support the right to strike, but not try and convince staff to do what we presume is best for them!</p>&mdash; Kate McIntosh (@DurhamSUpres) <a href="https://twitter.com/DurhamSUpres/status/1187684951296221186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2019</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The National Union of Students President Zamzam Ibrahim reiterated
that support and stated that: “We support and stand with UCU members in this
fight and will work with students&#8217; unions to build student support. We know
that together students and workers can and will win and we look forward to
building a better and more just education system together.&#8221;</p>

<p>A recent meeting of Durham County Council has listed daytime drinking, &#8216;aggressive begging&#8217; and late night noise in the city centre amongst the main antisocial problems facing the area.</p>



<p>At the meeting, attendees were told that police have stopped giving out community protection orders to students who have been the subject of noise complaints. It was deemed that leaving students with a potential criminal record due to noise complaints was an &#8216;inappropriate&#8217; use of the law.</p>



<p>In terms of new strategies, police agreed to trial a new tactic of having uniformed officers knock on doors whilst the prospect of more night-time wardens in problematic areas was also considered. Moreover, the idea of student volunteers performing similar duties on the streets was discussed.</p>



<p>Durham University declined to be part of the panel, which included various members from local politics and the wider civic community. Despite this, the university&#8217;s pro-vice chancellor Jeremy Cook and community liaison officer Hannah Shepherd both took part in the conference. Students&#8217; Union president Kate McIntosh was also in attendance.</p>



<p>Amongst the topics discussed was the possibility of a bespoke alcohol licensing policy being introduced for Durham City. This comes amidst complaints from residents about the ineffectiveness of the current response to antisocial behaviour, which they claim is doing little to combat the sleepless nights caused by noisy students.</p>



<p>Overall, it was agreed that there could be no quick fix to the issues being faced and that different sectors of the community working together was the only way forward.</p>

<p>Following the appointment of highly accredited architect,
Howard Litchfield, to the North East Universities Purchasing Consortium’s
Construction Professional Services Framework agreement (NEUPC), work has now
completed on his first project at Durham University. </p>



<p>The unusual project included the building of a mosquito laboratory and the refurbishment of a separate laboratory (Laboratory 5) in the Biological Science. The firm provided significant assistance in areas such as design and architecture. </p>



<p>The firm have already shown their 40 years experience in working with these complex scientific constructions, having been involved with the relocation of a locust house at Newcastle University, meaning they were well placed when it came to competing for the mosquito laboratory and Laboratory 5. </p>



<p>The construction of the 100 metres squared Laboratory 5, and 23 metres squared Mosquito Laboratory was facilitated through partnership with JH &amp; Partners and building was concluded ready for the 2019/20 academic year. The Mosquito Laboratory contains specialist incubators to house the mosquitos, with special structures put in place to ensure their safe keeping. </p>



<p>Durham University hope to support their research staff through promoting invertebrate research and developing appropriately modern facilities. This helps to ensures that research concerning genetic modification of various species (including fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster, mosquitoes and nematodes C.elegans, is made possible. </p>



<p>Professor Steve Lindsay, a world-leading expert on Malaria, along
with researchers at Durham University and worldwide, have been working for the
last 30 years trying to discover ways to not only treat the disease, but
prevent and control its spread. &nbsp;</p>
