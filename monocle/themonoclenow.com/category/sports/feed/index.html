<p>Activists are urging the British government to declare a state of emergency as concern grows that this might actually be Liverpool’s year.</p>



<p>With Manchester City throwing away points and Jurgen Klopp’s men finding increasingly infuriating ways to scrape victories, tensions have arisen across the country that Liverpool could be crowned Premier League champions.</p>



<p>&nbsp;One activist, who asked to remain nameless through fear of retribution from an Egyptian Twitter mob, commented: “We’ve reached the stage in this country where Liverpool supporters feel emboldened enough to call Gini Wijnaldum world class without fearing the consequences.</p>



<p>“And just last week, a friend of mine was met with repeated shouts of ‘CORNER TAKEN QUICKLY, ORIGI !!!’ on the streets merely for suggesting Mané played for the handball in the Champions League Final”</p>



<p>Indeed, research has confirmed that the smugness of Liverpool fans is at an all-time high since records began in 1992. This can be seen through not only the huge increase in commemorative t-shirts, but also in the number of grown men genuinely having Jordan Henderson as their Facebook profile picture.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Anti-Liverpool protesters have argued that the government’s large-scale purchase of beachballs is not enough to counter the threat, and many vow to continue their campaign until Howard Webb is brought out of retirement.</p>



<p>&nbsp;This week, MPs are expected to approve legislation that would grant Demba Ba sweeping powers to play against Liverpool each week. A similar bill that would safeguard Dejan Lovren’s place in the starting line-up will also be debated in the Chamber.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fringes of the movement, conspiracy theorists are trying to ascertain the nature of the link between Liverpool’s good fortune and Brexit. The common consensus is that Britain leaving the EU is a distraction from the real issue of Adam Lallana potentially winning a Premier League medal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;However, a growing number believe Brexit to be an elaborately orchestrated taster of the relentless banging on about the same thing that would follow any Liverpool title win.</p>



<p>&nbsp;One of the most controversial aspects of the debate centres around past instances of possible collusion between influential Liverpool players and the state. Numerous sources claim Steven Gerrard and Loris Karius to have been double agents working in the national interest by making mistakes at key moments.</p>



<p>&nbsp;A similar charge levelled against Alberto Moreno was dropped upon the discovery that he really was trying his best.</p>



<p>The anonymous activist warned: “It’s time the government started focusing on the real issues-not hard borders and climate disasters, or whatever it is they’re always on about. If not, what sort of society are we leaving to future generations?&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>We take a look at Man City's latest efforts to fill seats </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">It is well-known among fans of the premier league that Manchester City have been struggling to fill the Etihad since the injection of cash from owner Sheikh Mansour which marked the club’s succession to the big time. </p>



<p>This issue is especially pertinent during Champions League fixtures where thousands of empty seats can be seen across the 55,000 capacity stadium that cost £110 Million to build. </p>



<p>According to those at the top, the issue is exacerbated by playing lesser known European teams, a strange excuse that makes it sound as if an easier path through the group stages is not a desirable situation to be in. If you compare the attendance of last night’s game against Atalanta to Tottenham’s fixture against Red Star Belgrade, the London club drew in nearly 3,000 more fans. </p>



<p style="text-align:justify">The issue isn’t merely about the number of bums in seats on match day though, the atmosphere at the Etihad has been reported to be nothing like that which the club of old once provided. </p>



<p>One would think that a football team in a working class area like Manchester, who’s owner has invested net one billion pounds in the club, and millions on improving the lives of local people, would be able to get fans excited about their club winning games; whether it be against smaller teams such as Atalanta, or other top premier league clubs. </p>



<p style="text-align:justify">As a result of the reputation that the club is earning it has launched a campaign to recruit influencers who will act as ambassadors for match days in the hopes that they will draw in bigger crowds. </p>



<p>It is clear that the ownership at City are hoping their long-term tactic of buying success on the pitch will work off it by getting those with large social media followers to get more people to attend. I have a feeling, however, that even if these new influencers manage to fill  6,000 empty seats, people who actually listen to Instagram ‘celebrities’ will hardly create an atmosphere worthy of such a historic club. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ben Sampson discusses the criticism LeBron James has received for his lack of support for Hong Kong.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">LeBron James has found himself the subject of criticism after failing to support Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey’s support of the current political struggle in Hong Kong. James suggested Morey was ‘uninformed’ about the situation arising in the region, suggesting it would have been wiser for him to stay quiet.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p style="text-align:justify">The star basketball player is perhaps wise to steer clear of criticising China. China has invested hugely into the NBA, and have been key to the financial growth of the NBA, making it particularly alarming that following the controversial tweet many Chinese companies immediately cut ties with the organisation. It seems then that James has an invested interest in keeping China cosy, as not only are they both capable of great leaps forward, China also pays his wages. He pleaded for people to consider what they tweet in the future about such sensitive topics, showing concern for what could harm people physically, emotionally, spiritually, but most importantly it seems, financially.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p style="text-align:justify">Some may be surprised to hear that basketball has been incredibly popular in China for over a century. Christian missionaries, while failing to bring Christianity, were successful in bringing the sport to the East. Mao Zedong proved to be a huge fan, leading it to become so popular during the cultural revolution that it and ping pong became the only two acceptable sports to play. The communist party lauded the sports ability to boost camaraderie and solidarity among their troops, something apparently literally no other sport could do. It is even reported that The People’s Liberation Army began to play basketball in internal organised leagues, offering high military ranks and luxurious lifestyles to star players, something which no doubt was essential to achieving the camaraderie they hoped to achieve.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p style="text-align:justify">James, despite not being keen on speaking out against China, has gained a reputation of being consistently outspoken on controversial issues in his own country. He showed solidarity with Colin Kaepernick and the Black Lives Matter movement, and has a history of criticising the Trump administration.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p style="text-align:justify">High profile politicians and public figures have condemned James’s comments and lack of support for Morey and Hong Kong. This included Ted Cruz, who was furious when James spoke out in support of American civil rights, but was equally irate that James had not spoken in support of Chinese civil rights.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p style="text-align:justify">In fairness the timing of Morey’s tweet was spectacularly poor, as James’ Lakers arrived in China for a series of pre season games the day after the tweet. With his hands tied, the decision to suggest Morey was ‘uninformed’ may have been a necessary diplomatic move to keep the peace for a week, something James’ president has struggled to manage in his tenure.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p style="text-align:justify">All this played out in the backdrop of an ongoing trade war between the US and China, which both sides are reluctant to budge on. The growing tension in the international sphere between the US, China, and Hong Kong has been a sobering remainder for the NBA of the political cost of Chinese investment, even for an organisation priding itself on its members ability to engage in free speech and activism.<br></p>
