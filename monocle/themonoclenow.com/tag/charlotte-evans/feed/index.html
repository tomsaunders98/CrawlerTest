<p>The Monocle sits down with participants in the Hong Kong protests in Durham. </p>



<p>The protests in Hong Kong have been unlike any other in
recent memory. Geographically they may be far away. However, they have ignited
protest organically in universities across the globe from Brisbane to Bristol.</p>



<p>Just recently a total of 78 Hong Kong-affiliated student
groups from across the globe released a <em>Joint Statement on Police Brutality
and Academic Freedom</em>. The full list of signatories includes groups in the
Netherlands, Los Angeles, New Zealand and of course Durham.</p>



<p>At the Monocle we sat down with members of the Durham Hong Kong protests to understand how this international phenomenon arose and what it is all about. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1300" height="975" src="https://i0.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-5-done.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-330" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-5-done.jpg?w=1300&amp;ssl=1 1300w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-5-done.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-5-done.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-5-done.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<h1>How the protests came about</h1>



<p>The organisers were initially very clear to emphasise that
there was no central chain of command linking these protest groups from across
the world.</p>



<p>“It’s not centralised at all, it’s very similar to the movement itself back home, there is no central platform, it is all people coming out and saying: we don’t want this.”</p>



<p>The decentralisation of the movement is more than merely circumstantial,
in many ways it seems to be what has made them so incredibly effective.</p>



<p>“When I have signed up to be a helper in a London protest, I am not notified about anything until last minute and everything still works out fine. I think this not only represents how the leaderless thing works, but how it has become the characteristic of HK people all over the world.”</p>



<p>“It shows that not everything is centralised, and everyone has their own say in the whole movement as well.”</p>



<h1>Dealing with counter-protests</h1>



<p>The protests have been met with some opposition and there
have been some incidents in which Hong Kong protesters have come into contact
with counter-protesters.</p>



<p>The protesters mentioned an incident which took place at Sheffield University where one man was arrested in a counter-protest under suspicion of committing a public order offence.</p>



<p>After this interview took place, there was a counter
demonstration by Chinese supporters to the Hong Kong protesters. The atmosphere
was tense.</p>



<p>“We know there are risks of counter protesters, but we believe dialogue is the most important thing. The fact we are lucky enough to study at university and have this opportunity whereas a lot of places around the world don’t have this space for dialogue. Therefore, it is important to talk to as many people as possible even though we know they have different preconceptions of our movement.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1243" height="932" src="https://i0.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-3-another.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-329" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-3-another.jpg?w=1243&amp;ssl=1 1243w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-3-another.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-3-another.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-3-another.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<h1>What is it like in Hong Kong?</h1>



<p>Whilst English universities have supported the Hong Kong protestors&#8217; right to free speech, and Durham is no exception, the reality in Hong Kong as most know is very different.</p>



<p>“Often the running joke is, because many of the people in the protests are quite young, often secondary school students, and the skill which they’ve learnt over the summer is the ability to diffuse teargas in a few seconds. That’s not the experience some of us have but it’s the idea that you will be affected by teargas one way or the other. You can be coming off work, or having a meal with somebody, and you’ll see teargas going off somewhere.”</p>



<p>“It’s something ridiculous like 80% of all HK people have been affected by teargas.”</p>

</div><figcaption>August 31 inside a train</figcaption></figure>



<h1>What do they want?</h1>



<p>Often people assume that what the Hong Kong protests are all about is independence from China, but the people we talked to were all quick to emphasise that this is far from their main goal</p>



<p>“The line of argument often going against the Hong Kong movement is that HK is trying to get away from China, it’s a territorial dispute, but no this is absolutely not what we are trying to do.”</p>



<p>In fact, what unites the protests all around the world as
well as Hong Kong are five relatively simple demands:</p>



<ol><li>Formal withdrawal of the extradition bill.</li><li>Exoneration and release of arrested protesters.</li><li>Independent commission and enquiry into police brutality .</li><li>The government to withdraw the use of the word “riot” in relation to protests.</li><li>Implementation of genuine universal suffrage.</li></ol>



<p>Ultimately, it seems that the protests in Durham and around
the world are about exercising their respective right to free speech in support
of those whose right is under threat.</p>



<p>“University is and should be a place of freedom of speech and expression it is a very good place to show what this is about and show that in fact free speech and expression isn’t always the case around the world nowadays as we see in Hong Kong.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Communication Workers Union (CWU), a postal union, have
been accused of making a “politically calculated” plan to strike over the
December election period, potentially jeopardising the counting of up to a
fifth of votes over disputes regarding bonuses and pay. </p>



<p>The Union, who on Monday revealed its latest strategy was to
refuse to deliver not only postal votes but also campaign material, are doing
so in order to prompt a new agreement by Royal Mail on jobs and conditions. </p>



<p>The move has triggered many concerned conversations on the
topic whether those not able to vote in their preferred constituency should
cancel postal vote registrations and vote by proxy instead, fearing millions of
votes going uncounted in arguably one of the most historic elections in recent
history. </p>



<p>The potential strike could hinder Corbyn’s own chances at
Number 10, potentially jeopardising the votes of thousands of students choosing
to vote in home constituencies whilst still being at university, or vice versa.
</p>



<p>However, due to the fact that almost half of Conservative
voters are aged 65 or over, and the age group are amongst the most likely in
society to request a postal vote, discussions have begun as to whether the move
was politically timed to boost the Labour Leader’s chances at the ballot box. </p>



<p>This prompted Andrea Leadsom, the Business Minister, to
suggest the CWU had indeed deliberately timed the potential strike. </p>



<p>“The timing of this threat is clearly politically calculated
and would disrupt both the election and people’s Christmas deliveries,” she
said.</p>



<p>She added the disruption would be “a taste of things to
come” if Jeremy Corbyn is elected prime minister next month. </p>



<p>Each general election, Royal Mail postal workers are given
compensation in the form of bonuses for the additional workload caused by
postal votes and significant amounts of campaign material. During the 2017
election these bonuses were set at an average of £267 each, a figure the
Communication Workers Union is demanding Royal Mail increases as part of wider
industrial disputes. </p>



<p>The 140,000 members of the CWU voted overwhelmingly in
favour of the strike, those in favour accounting for a staggering 97% of the
vote. Their reasons for striking covered a range of topics outside of just
bonuses, such as Royal Mail’s failure to uphold agreed deals on pensions and
conditions drawn up last year. </p>



<p>In a statement issued by Royal Mail, they remained committed to
ensuring the handling of postal election material “will be our number one
priority.” Shane O’Riordain continued, “We will invest significant resource to
seek to ensure a seamless process for the handling of postal election material.
Royal Mail volunteers will also work on the processing and delivery of election
mail.”</p>



<p>Regarding Royal Mail’s efforts to come to an agreement with the
CWU, Mr O’Riordain detailed “Royal Mail is also meeting the CWU as a matter of
urgency to discuss the union’s request for an increase in the dedicated
payments postmen and women receive for delivering each poll card and individual
item of candidate mail.” In addition, despite the growing frustration and
anxiety surrounding the situation, no strike action has definitely been
confirmed as of yet, “The recent ballot result for industrial action does not
necessarily mean that industrial action will take place.”</p>



<p>However, concern is not wholly unwarranted, as in the 2017 General
election over eight million votes were cast by post. Experts have warned that,
should significant disruption occur, the final election result could be left
open to legal action. </p>



<p>In addition to this, frustration over the supposed political
interest of the CWU seems to have stemmed from the union’s General Secretary,
Dave Ward’s close relationship to Jeremy Corbyn, claiming during the 2015
leadership campaign that Corbyn had to be elected to rid society of the
“Blairite virus”. </p>



<p>Described as a lifelong socialist, Mr Ward has been an active
union member since the 1970s, having joined Royal Mail at just 16 years old. </p>

<p>A former Durham University head of department within the Business School has been suspended from his current role of Principal and Vice Chancellor at the University of Dundee. He had taken up the position, which is estimated to pay around £300,000 per year on January 1<sup>st</sup> 2019, with the suspension arising just nine months later on September 13<sup>th</sup>. </p>



<p>It is alleged that Professor Andrew Atherton failed to pay
rent for accommodation which was being provided to him through the employer. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/dundee/1010699/298k-a-year-dundee-university-principal-suspended-for-allegedly-not-paying-rent/">The Courier</a> has alleged that Professor Atherton was staying at University House, on Perth Road, when he failed to cover the full cost of rent. </p>



<p>During his time at Durham University from 1995 to 2002, the Professor worked as a director of the Policy Research Unit within the Small Business Centre, before becoming Head of Department. </p>



<p>A Mandarin Chinese speaker, he has also advised both national and regional government as well as various agencies on enterprise and small business policy development and implementation. </p>



<p>In addition to holding positions at Durham and Dundee universities,
Professor Atherton also worked for the University of Lincoln as the Senior
Deputy Vice-Chancellor and played an important role in the creation of the new
School of Engineering, the first of its kind in the UK for 20 years. It was
created alongside Siemens and opened for use in 2011. </p>



<p>He also held the role of Deputy Vice- Chancellor and Professor of Enterprise at Lancaster University, and is said to be an expert in China and SME policy. </p>

<p>Following the appointment of highly accredited architect,
Howard Litchfield, to the North East Universities Purchasing Consortium’s
Construction Professional Services Framework agreement (NEUPC), work has now
completed on his first project at Durham University. </p>



<p>The unusual project included the building of a mosquito laboratory and the refurbishment of a separate laboratory (Laboratory 5) in the Biological Science. The firm provided significant assistance in areas such as design and architecture. </p>



<p>The firm have already shown their 40 years experience in working with these complex scientific constructions, having been involved with the relocation of a locust house at Newcastle University, meaning they were well placed when it came to competing for the mosquito laboratory and Laboratory 5. </p>



<p>The construction of the 100 metres squared Laboratory 5, and 23 metres squared Mosquito Laboratory was facilitated through partnership with JH &amp; Partners and building was concluded ready for the 2019/20 academic year. The Mosquito Laboratory contains specialist incubators to house the mosquitos, with special structures put in place to ensure their safe keeping. </p>



<p>Durham University hope to support their research staff through promoting invertebrate research and developing appropriately modern facilities. This helps to ensures that research concerning genetic modification of various species (including fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster, mosquitoes and nematodes C.elegans, is made possible. </p>



<p>Professor Steve Lindsay, a world-leading expert on Malaria, along
with researchers at Durham University and worldwide, have been working for the
last 30 years trying to discover ways to not only treat the disease, but
prevent and control its spread. &nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Plans for Durham University to add an additional 3000
students to its already pressuring 18,707 strong population have been revealed,
with the city’s local population claiming that, as a result, promises have been
broken. </p>



<p>These promises largely include limiting the number of
students able to attend the university in order to alleviate the pressure placed
on the wider city of Durham, one of the smallest in the UK. Pressures such as
housing are largely specified, detailing the lack of first-time buyers able to
purchase within the city due to the significantly warped housing market arising
due to students being charged up to six times higher rent prices than an
average family would pay.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Around 1000 former and therefore potential family homes are being used to house the ever-growing student population, a cause for which could be the university’s refusal to build on their own land, forcing over half of the students, around 64%, into neighbouring communities, continually pushing local residents further and further from the city centre. </p>



<p>The Vice Chancellor of Durham University, Professor
Corbridge, when asked to comment on issues related to university growth by Look
North, could do so little more than to emphasise the fact that through the
university, £400m is brought in every year. 

Though a staggering figure at a glance, when
accommodation and tuition fees are considered, this actually leaves an almost
negligible amount of spending money being invested back into the local
community.&nbsp;
