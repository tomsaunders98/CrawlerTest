<p>Kanye West has shocked the globe as it seems he may finally fulfil his role as a musician and release his music. He announced his much anticipated and much delayed gospel album will be released on the 25th October, but at the time of writing this there was no sign of said album as fans grow increasingly frustrated at the maverick artist.<br></p>



<p>Mr West informed fans on twitter that he was finishing mixing some tracks, and would ‘not sleep till this is done’, sending out serious student during summative season vibes.<br></p>



<p>The self professed ‘greatest artist of all time’ has already pushed back his album multiple times, and it has yet to be clarified if Kanye has the 25th October 2019 in mind. Some have speculated he is aiming for a 2020 release to coincide with a late run for the presidency, although unlikely he will run against his close friend Mr Trump.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Kanye, a man who once walked around calling himself Yeezus, has recently undergone a religious awakening, naming his new album Jesus Is King. Some of his new found christian beliefs include abolishing the 13th amendment (which outlawed slavery), calling slavery a choice, and throwing his support behind ultra right wing president Donald trump.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>He has also expressed regret over any explicit language used in his previous songs, citing his regression from writing Jesus Walks to I Love It, a song where he professes his everlasting love for Hoes, no doubt to the delight of his wife and kids. West suggested that ‘The devil was happy on that day’, but it remains highly unlikely anyone enjoyed that one.<br></p>



<p>Kanye likened the delay of his album to the frustration of Christians for the second coming of Christ in a recent interview with Complex. For now though, we can all put the second coming out our minds, and instead pray that Kanye drops the album sometime relatively soon.<br></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>A look at the governments decision to abandon age verification for access to adult content websites.</p>

<p>There was a huge sigh of relief across the country this week as the government announced it has scrapped its plan to require picture ID to access online porn websites.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The plan was initially proposed based on concern of young children accidentally stumbling across porn sites while they used the internet. But implementing the plan has proven to be incredibly difficult, with a number of loopholes showing how easily could be sidestepped. The Guardian reported in April how one proposed verification system could be bypassed in a matter of minutes, which is pretty impressive for a lonely employee on their lunch break.<br></p>



<p>Confusion also surrounds the fine print of the proposals. A site must comply if advertised as a pornographic website, or if one third of their content is pornographic. It is unclear what is being measured if by a third it is supposed to be images, or text or something else. </p>



<p>It is also unclear on how we classify an image as pornographic, where do we draw the line as to where a  revealing picture becomes pornographic? Some may argue the more saucy renaissance paintings could fall under the category or porn if showing images of nude women, but surely we should not suggest age limits to view this content in national art galleries.<br></p>



<p>The verification also covers audio porn, a genre becoming increasingly popular among the visually impaired. But there is no such ban on written work, only on audio visual content. So it seems one can write anything as explicit as they want, but God forbid someone were to read this out and post the audio online, showing some bizzare favouritism to the deaf over the blind.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>There was also privacy concerns over the collection of personal information that could be hacked to reveal potentially embarrassing personal habits of individuals. Something similar happened after the infidelity website Ashely Madison was hacked in 2015 implicating a large number of Australian government officials, but I’m sure British members of parliament would have nothing to worry about.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The social media site Tumblr blocked any NSFW content on their platform for similar concerns, and saw a fifth of their users abandon them in the first 3 months following the ban according to the independent. A petition reaching 600,000 signatures argued that the pornographic content was 90% of the reason anyone used the site anyway.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>It seems though, at least for the foreseeable future, the UK will not see an age restriction on it’s adult content sites, and we will not see 18 years olds gleefully head down to the post office on their birthdays to purchase their ‘porn pass’. <br></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ben Sampson discusses the criticism LeBron James has received for his lack of support for Hong Kong.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p style="text-align:justify">LeBron James has found himself the subject of criticism after failing to support Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey’s support of the current political struggle in Hong Kong. James suggested Morey was ‘uninformed’ about the situation arising in the region, suggesting it would have been wiser for him to stay quiet.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p style="text-align:justify">The star basketball player is perhaps wise to steer clear of criticising China. China has invested hugely into the NBA, and have been key to the financial growth of the NBA, making it particularly alarming that following the controversial tweet many Chinese companies immediately cut ties with the organisation. It seems then that James has an invested interest in keeping China cosy, as not only are they both capable of great leaps forward, China also pays his wages. He pleaded for people to consider what they tweet in the future about such sensitive topics, showing concern for what could harm people physically, emotionally, spiritually, but most importantly it seems, financially.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p style="text-align:justify">Some may be surprised to hear that basketball has been incredibly popular in China for over a century. Christian missionaries, while failing to bring Christianity, were successful in bringing the sport to the East. Mao Zedong proved to be a huge fan, leading it to become so popular during the cultural revolution that it and ping pong became the only two acceptable sports to play. The communist party lauded the sports ability to boost camaraderie and solidarity among their troops, something apparently literally no other sport could do. It is even reported that The People’s Liberation Army began to play basketball in internal organised leagues, offering high military ranks and luxurious lifestyles to star players, something which no doubt was essential to achieving the camaraderie they hoped to achieve.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p style="text-align:justify">James, despite not being keen on speaking out against China, has gained a reputation of being consistently outspoken on controversial issues in his own country. He showed solidarity with Colin Kaepernick and the Black Lives Matter movement, and has a history of criticising the Trump administration.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p style="text-align:justify">High profile politicians and public figures have condemned James’s comments and lack of support for Morey and Hong Kong. This included Ted Cruz, who was furious when James spoke out in support of American civil rights, but was equally irate that James had not spoken in support of Chinese civil rights.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p style="text-align:justify">In fairness the timing of Morey’s tweet was spectacularly poor, as James’ Lakers arrived in China for a series of pre season games the day after the tweet. With his hands tied, the decision to suggest Morey was ‘uninformed’ may have been a necessary diplomatic move to keep the peace for a week, something James’ president has struggled to manage in his tenure.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p style="text-align:justify">All this played out in the backdrop of an ongoing trade war between the US and China, which both sides are reluctant to budge on. The growing tension in the international sphere between the US, China, and Hong Kong has been a sobering remainder for the NBA of the political cost of Chinese investment, even for an organisation priding itself on its members ability to engage in free speech and activism.<br></p>
