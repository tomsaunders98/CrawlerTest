<p>Amidst the chaos of Brexit, Britain has suddenly remembered about the other piece of its Kingdom.</p>



<p>&nbsp;But what of the politics of this strange land of bonfires and borders?&nbsp;Ahead of the upcoming election, <em>The Monocle&nbsp;</em>makes a brief inquiry into Northern Ireland’s political parties.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong> The Main Contenders</strong></p>



<p><strong>Democratic Unionist Party:&nbsp;</strong>We kick things off with the good folks who brought you homophobia and climate change denial. Still up in arms about the introduction of equal marriage and reproductive rights, expect them to make the most of their final gasp of relevance on a UK-wide level. Quite impressive in that each of their MPs manages to be individually dislikeable.</p>



<p><strong>Sinn Féin:&nbsp;</strong>The abstentionist republicans have made a strong start to their campaign to out-twat the DUP by having  IRA bomber and convicted mass murderer Sean Kelly canvass for one of their candidates. A further slip of the mask of inclusiveness came when their Queen’s University society displayed a ‘Brits Out’ banner during their Fresher’s Fair. But you can’t be wrong if you’re always the victim, right?</p>



<p><strong>Ulster Unionist Party:&nbsp;</strong>The more moderate unionist party’s incoming party leader Steve Aiken vowed to stand up to the DUP, and then immediately backtracked on a promise to field a candidate in every constituency to avoid splitting the unionist vote in North Belfast. That’ll show ‘em you’re not just a doormat.</p>



<p><strong>Social Democratic Labour Party:&nbsp;</strong>Sinn Féin’s more vanilla cousins are seeking to claw back moderate nationalist votes. As with the UUP, they’ve been steadily losing votes to the hardliners in recent years. You’d almost feel sorry for them if they weren’t so incredibly dull.</p>



<p><strong>Alliance Party:&nbsp;</strong>This liberal, non-sectarian party has long been the subject of scorn for its attempts to see past the religious divide. How dare they try to build a better future? The political equivalent of a plain ham sandwich and ready salted crisps meal deal.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"> <strong>And the Rest</strong></p>



<p><strong>Traditional Unionist Voice:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, this pro-Union party manages to make the DUP look a bit tame. Essentially the one-man-band of ex-DUP grandee Jim Allister, it remains to be seen whether they’ll bother standing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Green Party:</strong>They’re basically a Prius-driving Alliance Party but with an even more self-congratulatory support base. You can be sure all five of their voters will be sobbing over their quinoa when they don’t win any seats.</p>



<p><strong>Aontú:&nbsp;</strong>This new all-Ireland party is the brainchild of republicans impressed by the DUP’s example of turning the Old Testament into a political manifesto.&nbsp;The name means (*checks notes*) ‘unity’, which seems apt considering how they’ve managed to unite all the bad points of the DUP and Sinn Féin into one political abomination.</p>



<p><strong>People Before Profit:&nbsp;</strong>As the name suggests, they’re not big on the whole capitalism thing. It must be hard to start a revolution when nobody knows who you are.</p>



<p><strong>NI Conservatives:&nbsp;</strong>So irrelevant that Boris Johnson probably doesn’t know they exist. Essentially the San Marino football team of the political scene, you have them some credit for persisting even whilst getting decimated in every election.</p>

<p>A recent meeting of Durham County Council has listed daytime drinking, &#8216;aggressive begging&#8217; and late night noise in the city centre amongst the main antisocial problems facing the area.</p>



<p>At the meeting, attendees were told that police have stopped giving out community protection orders to students who have been the subject of noise complaints. It was deemed that leaving students with a potential criminal record due to noise complaints was an &#8216;inappropriate&#8217; use of the law.</p>



<p>In terms of new strategies, police agreed to trial a new tactic of having uniformed officers knock on doors whilst the prospect of more night-time wardens in problematic areas was also considered. Moreover, the idea of student volunteers performing similar duties on the streets was discussed.</p>



<p>Durham University declined to be part of the panel, which included various members from local politics and the wider civic community. Despite this, the university&#8217;s pro-vice chancellor Jeremy Cook and community liaison officer Hannah Shepherd both took part in the conference. Students&#8217; Union president Kate McIntosh was also in attendance.</p>



<p>Amongst the topics discussed was the possibility of a bespoke alcohol licensing policy being introduced for Durham City. This comes amidst complaints from residents about the ineffectiveness of the current response to antisocial behaviour, which they claim is doing little to combat the sleepless nights caused by noisy students.</p>



<p>Overall, it was agreed that there could be no quick fix to the issues being faced and that different sectors of the community working together was the only way forward.</p>

<p>Activists are urging the British government to declare a state of emergency as concern grows that this might actually be Liverpool’s year.</p>



<p>With Manchester City throwing away points and Jurgen Klopp’s men finding increasingly infuriating ways to scrape victories, tensions have arisen across the country that Liverpool could be crowned Premier League champions.</p>



<p>&nbsp;One activist, who asked to remain nameless through fear of retribution from an Egyptian Twitter mob, commented: “We’ve reached the stage in this country where Liverpool supporters feel emboldened enough to call Gini Wijnaldum world class without fearing the consequences.</p>



<p>“And just last week, a friend of mine was met with repeated shouts of ‘CORNER TAKEN QUICKLY, ORIGI !!!’ on the streets merely for suggesting Mané played for the handball in the Champions League Final”</p>



<p>Indeed, research has confirmed that the smugness of Liverpool fans is at an all-time high since records began in 1992. This can be seen through not only the huge increase in commemorative t-shirts, but also in the number of grown men genuinely having Jordan Henderson as their Facebook profile picture.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Anti-Liverpool protesters have argued that the government’s large-scale purchase of beachballs is not enough to counter the threat, and many vow to continue their campaign until Howard Webb is brought out of retirement.</p>



<p>&nbsp;This week, MPs are expected to approve legislation that would grant Demba Ba sweeping powers to play against Liverpool each week. A similar bill that would safeguard Dejan Lovren’s place in the starting line-up will also be debated in the Chamber.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fringes of the movement, conspiracy theorists are trying to ascertain the nature of the link between Liverpool’s good fortune and Brexit. The common consensus is that Britain leaving the EU is a distraction from the real issue of Adam Lallana potentially winning a Premier League medal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;However, a growing number believe Brexit to be an elaborately orchestrated taster of the relentless banging on about the same thing that would follow any Liverpool title win.</p>



<p>&nbsp;One of the most controversial aspects of the debate centres around past instances of possible collusion between influential Liverpool players and the state. Numerous sources claim Steven Gerrard and Loris Karius to have been double agents working in the national interest by making mistakes at key moments.</p>



<p>&nbsp;A similar charge levelled against Alberto Moreno was dropped upon the discovery that he really was trying his best.</p>



<p>The anonymous activist warned: “It’s time the government started focusing on the real issues-not hard borders and climate disasters, or whatever it is they’re always on about. If not, what sort of society are we leaving to future generations?&#8221;</p>
