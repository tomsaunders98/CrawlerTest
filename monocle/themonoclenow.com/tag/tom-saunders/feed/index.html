										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At the Monocle we have been tracking how many Coronavirus tests have been performed for 33 different countries around the world. Testing for Covid-19 is often the mark by which a country’s response to the crisis is measured.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We have a simple message for all countries: test test test. Test every suspected case.</p><cite>World Health Organization (WHO) head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus</cite></blockquote>



<p>The UK government has been criticised for its lack of testing and some figures within government, such as the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, have made bold claims about scaling up testing.</p>



<p>The UK government has been criticised for its lack of testing and some figures within government, such as the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, have made bold claims about scaling up testing.</p>



<h1><strong>Matt Hancock says: 100,000 tests a day by end of April</strong></h1>



<p>Matt Hancock recently said that by the end of the month he hopes to have scaled up testing to 100,000 tests a day. On the face of it this seems like a tall order for a country which to date has only managed to administer slightly less than 300,000 tests.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1000testsperday.png?resize=1000%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-381" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1000testsperday.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1000testsperday.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1000testsperday.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The green line represents what 100,000 tests per day would look like, whilst the red line shows the UK’s current testing output since the 30<sup>th</sup> of March.</p>



<p>What is clear from this graph is that the daily increase in testing is only a fraction of the 100,000 goal. The gradient of the UK’s line looks almost flat in comparison to what 100,000 tests per day looks like. Indeed, from the 9<sup>th</sup> to the 10<sup>th </sup>of April, the UK only performed 16,095 tests which is nowhere near the 100,000 target.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether the UK can pull off such a huge increase over the next few weeks, although the initial data is not very encouraging.</p>



<h1><strong>Who is doing the most testing?</strong></h1>



<p>Whilst the UK may be struggling to increase its testing output, other countries have scaled up their diagnostics and production capabilities to wartime levels. </p>



<p>This graph showThis graph shows the highest tests output of all the countries monitored so far:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TestsArticle3.png?resize=1000%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-382" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TestsArticle3.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TestsArticle3.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TestsArticle3.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Unclear Measurement means that none was specified in the reported data. The measurement it most probably the number of Laboratory Samples Analysed</figcaption></figure>



<p>Germany has the second highest testing output of any country monitored, even though their data is over a week old. Whilst the UK does fairly well in this graph it must be noted that France’s data is also a week out of date compared to most countries and, even then, the UK is only marginally in front.  </p>



<h1><strong>Who is doing the best testing?</strong></h1>



<p>This is helpful to show which countries have the largest diagnostic and testing capabilities but a lot of the countries that the UK comes above have populations which are far smaller than the UK and so do not need to do anywhere near the amount of testing.</p>



<p>When adjusting for population the UK’s situation looks far worse:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTest5.png?resize=1000%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-383" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTest5.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTest5.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTest5.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Unclear Measurement means that none was specified in the reported data. The measurement it most probably the number of Laboratory Samples Analysed</figcaption></figure>



<p>Clearly, the UK’s testing output so far leaves a lot to be desired.</p>



<p>This also explains why some countries have a lower mortality rate than the United Kingdom. Countries such as Germany can afford to implement widespread testing; if you are suspected of having coronavirus in Germany you can quite easily get a test. However in the UK, due to the shortage of tests, only the most serious cases are tested which then inflates the overall mortality rate.</p>



<h1><strong>What about Japan?</strong></h1>



<p>According to Reuters Japan is only using 1/6<sup>th</sup> of its testing capacity. It is not exactly clear why Japan’s test output is so incredibly low compared to other developed nations.</p>



<p>Some have speculated that part of the reason is that companies and government bodies have been reluctant to take aggressive measures to combat the spread of the virus which may lead to heavy losses and an economic downturn.</p>



<p>It seems that aggressive testing is one of these measures that the government is unwilling to pursue.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In the first place, we believe there is not so much need for testing in Japan (as in other countries)</p><cite>Takuma Kato, deputy director of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare’s infectious diseases control division (March 11)</cite></blockquote>



<h1><strong>If we test more will the Lockdown by over sooner ? </strong></h1>



<p>Austria, Denmark and the Czech Republic have all announced plans to start easing social distancing restrictions.</p>



<p>There are many factors which go into beating the virus but it is interesting that all three countries have completed far more tests per capita than the UK.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTests1.png?resize=1000%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-384" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTests1.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTests1.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ArticleTests1.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Unclear Measurement means that none was specified in the reported data. The measurement it most probably the number of Laboratory Samples Analysed</figcaption></figure>



<p>Denmark has announced that schools and day care centres will reopen on the 15<sup>th</sup> of April and the Czech Republic has announced that it will expand the type of shops that are allowed to remain open. Austria has also announced that it will look to reopen some shops by the 14<sup>th</sup> April.</p>



<p>All three countries test far more people comparatively than the UK. The UK has indicated that the lockdown will almost certainly be extended. If the UK’s testing output is anything to go by, it might be extending for a whole lot longer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At Durham University Library, Hong Kong protesters stand in
a phalanx in silence, black masks over their faces, large cardboard posters in
their hands. Students, typically, take no notice. They walk past, generally
supportive but ultimately uninterested. However, today is different; opposite
the protesters stand a small group of pro-mainland students holding Chinese
flags. No words are spoken, but the air fills with a tentative silence. Other
students watch on, some in apprehension, others in fascination. The world has
come to Durham.</p>



<p>At the grassroot level, these pro-democracy confrontations
have spread rapidly across nations that have stayed studiously silent on the
protests. In small university towns, thousands of miles from China,
pro-democracy protesters are clashing with supporters of Xi Jinping’s
government, sometimes violently. Durham, with a population of less than 50,000,
is one of these small cities. With perpetual grey skies and more pubs than Uber
drivers, Durham has never been an international or multicultural city. However,
as in most university towns across the West, this is changing.</p>



<p>Data from the Higher Education Statistics Authority shows
that the number of Chinese students at Durham has increased by over 30% in the
last four years and they now make up almost ten per cent of the university
population. This trend is replicated across the UK: according to HESA, last
year 31% of international students across the UK were from China. This trend
has transformed these Hong Kong protests from staid, often sparsely attended
student rallies, into dangerous and potentially violent confrontations. In
Sheffield one student was arrested after a confrontation, in Queensland,
Australia, students have received death threats from counter-protesters.</p>



<p>Often these confrontations are less about calls for
democracy in Hong Kong than they are about identity. As one protest leader in
Durham explained: “in order to differentiate themselves they try to build up
this HK identity, and this whole prejudice is emerging.” These identities,
built on nationalism, have served to inhibit dialogue and entrench positions on
both sides. </p>



<p>However, the battle-lines are not as neatly drawn as people
may think. “Talking to a lot of people helps break down the stereotype of
Chinese people as embracing the communist party” one Hong Kong protester added.
“I’ve met loads of people with different opinions on the Chinese government”.
Often Chinese students are reticent to state their opinions in public, mindful
of the dangers, fearful of whom they can trust. One student protester explained
that he knew many mainland Chinese who were critical of their government but as
he put it mildly, they “would be a bit wary” of voicing those beliefs.</p>



<p>As is often the case, dialogue between the groups, both formal
and informal, has engendered understanding and amongst some, acceptance. As one
Hong Kong protester reflected: “So I think a lot of people were wary of us, but
through talking we have managed to convince a few that our objectives are
peaceful … even to Chinese people we shouldn’t be seen as enemies.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Monocle speaks to one of  the foremost experts in AI on the "open source" phenomenon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a small research centre nestled in the Alps in
south-western Switzerland, in 2002 a group of researchers released an
Artificial Intelligence framework free to the public. They released the
framework as “Open Source”, meaning that the framework was not only free to
use, but the underlying code was available for anyone to learn from it, adapt
it or copy it. </p>



<p>The framework enjoyed lasting popularity; its successor,
PyTorch, is used by Facebook and the lead developer of the framework, Samy
Bengio, is now a research scientist at Google. Mr Bengio explained that when
his team released Torch: “we were in a very academic environment, so open
sourcing seemed totally legitimate and useful for reproducibility.”</p>



<p>The Open Source model has been a key part of the academic
community for a long time. In 2001, 40 members of the editorial board of the
Artificial Intelligence journal Machine Learning resigned, explaining that in
the era of the Internet it was wrong for researchers to publish their findings
in expensive pay-access archives. </p>



<p>This mindset has found its way into big technology firms who
are desperate to hire leading academics in the field of Artificial
Intelligence: “Publishing and open-sourcing are both part of a healthy
scientific community” added Mr Bengio, “Good researchers in our field know
that, and they also know that they can somehow choose their employer more than
their employer can choose them.” The list of companies that have embraced the
Open Source movement in relation to Artificial Intelligence reads like a Who’s
Who of the Tech World, Google, Intel, Facebook, Uber, Lyft, Microsoft and even
DARPA have contributed to the dizzying quantity of freely available AI tools.</p>



<p>Academics have been able to keep AI a largely open research
area because they see the Open Source model as a way to ensure that the field
moves as quickly as possible; that academics are able to build on each other’s
work as quickly and efficiently as possible. </p>



<p>However, there are risks. The implications of AI advancements
have potentially world-shattering consequences. AI, Mr Bengio acknowledged,
“could also help bad actors build problematic tools that could be used to harm
society. Think for instance about face recognition technology used by rogue
governments.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it seems that this worst-case scenario has
already become a reality. Last week, it was reported that Mr Ton-That, a
college drop out and one-time model, used freely available academic papers and
open sourced AI products to perfect a Facial Recognition algorithm. It was used
in concert with billions of photos scraped from social networks to create a
program that can be used to identify anyone from one single photo. His company,
Clearview, has licensed his product out to Police departments across the United
States. </p>



<p>Google and Microsoft both refrained from open sourcing their
facial recognition algorithms for fear of this very thing happening. However,
the overwhelming quantity of freely available products and expertise meant that
their efforts were ultimately in vain. It’s unclear whether the open source
movement will continue in the same vain but whether it does is unlikely to
affect AI in the near future. Even products such as Google’s AI text-to-speech
generator, which was debuted to much fanfare in 2018 at Google’s annual
conference, has been recreated in open source by programmers even though the
real thing remains propriety.

What this means for the tech world is unclear,
but its consequences could be dire. Hackers have already used AI to impersonate
the CEO of a U.K.-based energy firm, running away with €220,000. When asked
about whether large technology firms will be as committed to open source in AI
as they are now, Mr Bengio replied: “I&#8217;m not really good at reading the future
:-).”

<p>Lilian
Groves knows Durham. She was an undergraduate at the university, then a
lecturer and eventually the Vice Principal of Hilde-Bede college. Three weeks after
retiring she became a tour-guide for Durham Cathedral and 20 years later, at
the age of 91, she is still there.</p>



<p>Thinking
about her proudest moment she told me, full of modesty, “I suppose it was being
chosen as what was that called? Visit England Superstar. That was probably it.”</p>



<p>In
fact, in 2016 she won Durham Tourism Superstar and later in the same year the
national equivalent, Visit England Superstar. However, according to Lilian “it
was the lead up to it that was amazing as anything else. One of the cannons in
the cathedral wrote a song which the choristers sang, and it went viral.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ever
modest, she assured me all she had won was “a hideous plaque and a huge framed
certificate which is sitting on the floor in my study.”</p>



<p>When I
asked her who her favourite visitor was, she replied cautiously: “It’s hard to
say. I’ve taken Sting who told me that he wanted to adopt me as his mother.
I’ve taken Princess Anne, she was terrific fun, marvellous sense of humour.”</p>



<p>However,
her favourite was a local woman from Sunderland. Lilian explained that “she
came on a public tour and at the end of the tour she crossed my hands and said,
‘flower I wouldn’t have missed that for a million pounds.’ And I thought that
was brilliant, absolutely brilliant.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>10) The Independent Group for Change</h2>



<p>It just wasn’t meant to be.</p>



<h2>9) UKIP</h2>



<p>Remember them?</p>



<h2>8) Bolsover</h2>



<p>David Skinner did lose his seat but ultimately Bolsover has
lost their beast, and are worse off because of it.</p>



<h2>7) Greens</h2>



<p>Over 800,000 votes for just one seat and who says our
electoral system isn’t broken?</p>



<h2>6) DUP/ Nigel Dodds</h2>



<p>In the preceding year the DUP have had more political power
than they have ever enjoyed in their lifetime and what have they got to show
for it? Their Westminster leader is out, there will be a border between
Northern Ireland and the UK and&nbsp; for the
first time there are more nationalist than loyalist MPs in Northern Ireland.
Nice.</p>



<h2>5) Brexit Party</h2>



<p>As entertaining as it would have been to see the polo-player
and property millionaire Richard Tice represent the northern constituency of
Hartlepool the Brexit Party couldn’t even manage that.</p>



<h2>4) Independent Tories</h2>



<p>Goodbye Dominic Grieve, Goodbye David Gauke, Goodbye uhhh everyone
else. I don’t remember there being so many of them.</p>



<h2>3) Heidi Allen / Unite for Remain</h2>



<p>Two reasons why the Remain effort would be better off
without Heidi Allen and the electoral pact between the Lib Dems, Greens and
Plaid Cymru: Stroud and Kensington. Both constituencies could have potentially
been won by Labour MPs if it wasn’t for Unite to Remain splitting the vote. </p>



<p>There are no reasons why the Remain effort would be better
off with Heidi Allen as her pact failed to win any seats at all. </p>



<h2>2) Jeremy Corbyn / Labour</h2>



<p>He won the argument but he couldn’t convert it into a majority, which is why he will be top of my next list: 10 biggest winners in things that don’t matter this election.</p>



<h2>1)Jo Swinson / Lib Dems</h2>



<p>She called the election. She claimed she was essential to
stopping Brexit and that she could be the next prime minister. Ultimately, she
somehow ended up doing the polar opposite of both of these: unemployed and
essential to getting Brexit done.</p>

<p>The Monocle sits down with participants in the Hong Kong protests in Durham. </p>



<p>The protests in Hong Kong have been unlike any other in
recent memory. Geographically they may be far away. However, they have ignited
protest organically in universities across the globe from Brisbane to Bristol.</p>



<p>Just recently a total of 78 Hong Kong-affiliated student
groups from across the globe released a <em>Joint Statement on Police Brutality
and Academic Freedom</em>. The full list of signatories includes groups in the
Netherlands, Los Angeles, New Zealand and of course Durham.</p>



<p>At the Monocle we sat down with members of the Durham Hong Kong protests to understand how this international phenomenon arose and what it is all about. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1300" height="975" src="https://i0.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-5-done.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-330" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-5-done.jpg?w=1300&amp;ssl=1 1300w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-5-done.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-5-done.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-5-done.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<h1>How the protests came about</h1>



<p>The organisers were initially very clear to emphasise that
there was no central chain of command linking these protest groups from across
the world.</p>



<p>“It’s not centralised at all, it’s very similar to the movement itself back home, there is no central platform, it is all people coming out and saying: we don’t want this.”</p>



<p>The decentralisation of the movement is more than merely circumstantial,
in many ways it seems to be what has made them so incredibly effective.</p>



<p>“When I have signed up to be a helper in a London protest, I am not notified about anything until last minute and everything still works out fine. I think this not only represents how the leaderless thing works, but how it has become the characteristic of HK people all over the world.”</p>



<p>“It shows that not everything is centralised, and everyone has their own say in the whole movement as well.”</p>



<h1>Dealing with counter-protests</h1>



<p>The protests have been met with some opposition and there
have been some incidents in which Hong Kong protesters have come into contact
with counter-protesters.</p>



<p>The protesters mentioned an incident which took place at Sheffield University where one man was arrested in a counter-protest under suspicion of committing a public order offence.</p>



<p>After this interview took place, there was a counter
demonstration by Chinese supporters to the Hong Kong protesters. The atmosphere
was tense.</p>



<p>“We know there are risks of counter protesters, but we believe dialogue is the most important thing. The fact we are lucky enough to study at university and have this opportunity whereas a lot of places around the world don’t have this space for dialogue. Therefore, it is important to talk to as many people as possible even though we know they have different preconceptions of our movement.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1243" height="932" src="https://i0.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-3-another.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-329" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-3-another.jpg?w=1243&amp;ssl=1 1243w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-3-another.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-3-another.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/themonoclenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic-3-another.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<h1>What is it like in Hong Kong?</h1>



<p>Whilst English universities have supported the Hong Kong protestors&#8217; right to free speech, and Durham is no exception, the reality in Hong Kong as most know is very different.</p>



<p>“Often the running joke is, because many of the people in the protests are quite young, often secondary school students, and the skill which they’ve learnt over the summer is the ability to diffuse teargas in a few seconds. That’s not the experience some of us have but it’s the idea that you will be affected by teargas one way or the other. You can be coming off work, or having a meal with somebody, and you’ll see teargas going off somewhere.”</p>



<p>“It’s something ridiculous like 80% of all HK people have been affected by teargas.”</p>

<h1>What do they want?</h1>



<p>Often people assume that what the Hong Kong protests are all about is independence from China, but the people we talked to were all quick to emphasise that this is far from their main goal</p>



<p>“The line of argument often going against the Hong Kong movement is that HK is trying to get away from China, it’s a territorial dispute, but no this is absolutely not what we are trying to do.”</p>



<p>In fact, what unites the protests all around the world as
well as Hong Kong are five relatively simple demands:</p>



<ol><li>Formal withdrawal of the extradition bill.</li><li>Exoneration and release of arrested protesters.</li><li>Independent commission and enquiry into police brutality .</li><li>The government to withdraw the use of the word “riot” in relation to protests.</li><li>Implementation of genuine universal suffrage.</li></ol>



<p>Ultimately, it seems that the protests in Durham and around
the world are about exercising their respective right to free speech in support
of those whose right is under threat.</p>



<p>“University is and should be a place of freedom of speech and expression it is a very good place to show what this is about and show that in fact free speech and expression isn’t always the case around the world nowadays as we see in Hong Kong.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last month the<a href="https://www.savethestudent.org/money/student-money-survey-2019.html"> Nation Student Money survey</a> was released by Save the Student. Now in its sixth year it polled 3,385 students, making it the UK’s largest independent survey of its kind. </p>



<p>The report had some dire revelations, most noticeably that
79% of students polled worry about making ends meet – which is more students
than ever before. Only 38% of students said that their maintenance loans
stretched far enough.</p>



<p>Not all students are able to supplement their maintenance
loan with money from their parents or an overdraft. Furthermore, contrary to
what people outside university might think, many students simply don’t have
time to take on a part-time job in addition to their studies.</p>



<p>This leaves students with few options in order to make ends
meet. This is where commercial or payday loan companies come into play. The
survey noted that the popularity of payday loans has increased from 2018 to
2019.</p>



<p>These payday loans are often exploitative, and many have
begun to directly target cash-strapped students. </p>



<p>Many student unions in the UK have banned short-term lends
from advertising on campus and have made active efforts to instead promote
hardship funds instead.</p>



<p>When you type “Student Loan quick” into Google plenty of
results come up. Many advertise loans from £100-£5,000 which can be agreed and
paid in 15 minutes. One of the most prominent of these pay-day lenders is Smart
Pig which describes itself as “the only short-term loan created just for
students.” </p>



<p>Smart Pig is a perfect example of how an offshoot of the
already morally questionable pay-day loan industry deliberately attempts to influence
vulnerable students into loans which will often lead them into more debt.</p>



<p>On the page “<a href="https://www.smart-pig.com/About_Us/Our%20Story">Our Story</a>”, Smart Pig mentions how the company is a student start up and that their founders “have a strong ethical focus …  and really want to improve practices and reduce prices in the short-term loan industry.” It is unclear exactly what Smart Pig means when it talks of its “strong ethical focus”.</p>



<p>The company has already been in trouble for advertising on
beer mats, on the basis that it connected payday loans with drinking. It also
was forced to scrap an ‘irresponsible’ poster offering a £3,500 prize because
it encouraged students to take on debt. The poster told students that “Every
customer is entered into our competition to win a term’s rent up to £3,500.” </p>



<p>Its founders, former Goldman Sachs trader and WBFF Amateur
Fitness model Tom Parks and Shreiff Benazina, also own another short-term loan
company called Buffa Loans. Buffa Loans features a picture of a mother and
child prominently on its landing page and advertises loans with a
representative APR of 1087%, which is more than double the 448% APR of Smart
Pig. For comparison the APR on fixed rate credit cards is around 13% and for
variable rate credit cards around 16%.</p>



<p>In a article in the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ac97f30-c5cf-11e5-b3b1-7b2481276e45">Financial Times</a>, Mr Benazina explained that “We don’t just want to do loans,” says Mr Benazina. “We want to help people find accommodation and practice for job interviews.” However, at the time of saying that Mr Benazina had been a Director of Buffa Loans, for over two years and seemed to be doing exactly that. The Smart-Pig About Page makes no mention anywhere of their other payday loan ventures and clearly attempts to appear as a solely student focused venture created by good natured students when in reality, they are quite far from that. </p>



<p>If you, or anyone you know, are facing financial difficulties or are unable to pay back a loan from a pay day lender you can contact your local <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/">Citizen’s Advice Bureau</a> for help or take a look at <a href="https://debtcamel.co.uk">DebtCamel </a>which has advice about payday loans and how you may be able to apply for compensation. Durham University and some colleges also have financial support and hardship funds available to students, you can find more information <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/student.finance/current/support/">here</a>.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Let me take it for you.</p>



<p>If you haven’t read the original piece by Liddle, I suggest that you don’t and that you stop reading this too. That way you’ll have withheld the one thing Rod Liddle needs to survive: attention.</p>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t turned back already then its already too late for you, you might as well read Liddle&#8217;s piece <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/11/if-you-do-one-thing-this-election-stop-your-kids-voting/amp/">here </a>and then come back.</p>



<p>Rod Liddle is a troll. Contrary to what most people think it wasn’t kids or the internet who inventing trolling, it was Rod Liddle. Long before 10-year olds were shouting racist epithets down a £10 Xbox mic, Rod Liddle was calling Muslims savages. Long before Fifa obsessed adolescents were telling girls to make them a sandwich, Rod was being a crusty old creep, propositioning Harriet Harman on the front page of the Spectator. </p>



<p>And when people took a step back and said, hold on Rod this
is actually pretty weird, what did he do? Why of course, he turned around, smirked
and revealed that it was all just a joke! You see, he wasn’t actually a creepy
old man he was merely parodying being a creepy old man. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When Liddle was accused of being a racist for printing blatantly
false claims about the African-Caribbean community, Liddle instead held up his
hands in surrender and claimed, he was just asking questions. </p>



<p>If this doesn’t sound like an internet troll to you then you
clearly have never been on the internet. In many ways he is the godfather of
trolling, he craves reaction and attention more than they do and by and large
he gets it.</p>



<p>Sure, there are others who would possibly stake a claim for his crown: Piers Morgan and Katy Hopkins come to mind. However, there is no question Rod was there first.</p>



<p>This latest article is just more of the same charade. However, with one caveat: all beasts, even trolls, are mortal. As trolls continue to scream for attention people gradually become accustomed to the ringing in their ears and learn to ignore it. This is why they have to change their tune.</p>



<p>Some just go for broke, a la Katy Hopkins calling for A Final Solution against all Muslims. But Rod, Rod is an auteur, he knows better. Instead he’s gone for a new target which will know doubt provide a bit of sustenance at least for a while. Of course, there is the usual drivel about Muslims and women, an old dog can’t learn new tricks that easily.</p>



<p>Ultimately, all things must come to an end and so must Rod
Liddle. Internet trolls usually get banned after a while from whatever platform
they are on. But the Spectator in the name of “Freeze Peach”, has valiantly defended
Rod and likely will until the bitter end. </p>



<p>As we all get accustomed to the peculiar form of Rod Liddle tinnitus
that we all bare (I call it Liddinitus) just remember that doctors agree that
the best cure is to go and do something productive engaging to distract
yourself. </p>



<p>So, go and vote and join the more than 270,000 people under
35 that have registered to vote in the last few days.</p>

<p>79% of UCU members voted in favour of strike action in the
ballot over changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS). These
changes would have led to UCU members being approximately £240,000 worse off
due to changes in the pension scheme.</p>



<p>The results of the vote were first reported by the UCU on
the 31<sup>st</sup> of October. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The UCU of Durham also backed strike action due to pay
casualisation, equality and workloads. A recent report by the Universities and Colleges
Employers Association UCEA showed that pay for university staff has dropped by
around 17% in real terms since 2009.</p>



<p>Last year university campuses including Durham were brought
to a standstill over the USS pension scheme. </p>



<p>The UCU general secretary Jo Grady said: “&#8217;It is incredibly
frustrating that we had to ballot members again, but universities only have
themselves to blame after failing to address falling real-terms pay and for
refusing to deal with casualisation, workloads and the rising cost of USS
pensions.”</p>



<p>The strike action has been received positively by most Student Unions. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner called on both sides to get around the table for urgent talks and said that she fully supported UCU members fighting for fair pay and decent pensions.</p>



<p>The Durham Student Union President Kate McIntosh stated on twitter, that she was unequivocally in support of the strike but that strike action must be member-led.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m unequivical in my support for the right to strike &#8211; I know students really  care about fair pay &amp; pensions for uni staff. That said, strike action must be member-led. We should support the right to strike, but not try and convince staff to do what we presume is best for them!</p>&mdash; Kate McIntosh (@DurhamSUpres) <a href="https://twitter.com/DurhamSUpres/status/1187684951296221186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2019</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The National Union of Students President Zamzam Ibrahim reiterated
that support and stated that: “We support and stand with UCU members in this
fight and will work with students&#8217; unions to build student support. We know
that together students and workers can and will win and we look forward to
building a better and more just education system together.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A monocle investigation into sexual misconduct
cases at Durham University can reveal that between 2014 and December of 2018,
44% of Accused Parties in cases of sexual misconduct or violence left the
University before their hearing.</p>



<p>In the event that an incident of sexual
misconduct or violence occurs against a student at Durham, the student
essentially has three options: they can either report the incident to the
Police, to the University or not at all.</p>



<p>The University disclosed that within the timeframe previously stipulated (2014 and December of 2018) only 39% of cases were reported to Police even though it was assessed that 83% of cases which were reported could also have constituted &nbsp;a criminal offence. This reluctance to pursue criminal reports is understandable since a criminal trial l can be an immense emotional strain on a victim of sexual misconduct or violence. Not to mention that the high burden of proof (&#8220;beyond reasonable doubt&#8221;) makes securing a conviction &nbsp;difficult. Of the cases reported to the police where Durham was informed of the status of the criminal proceedings 75% had ended in No Further Action.</p>



<p>The second option available to students is to
report the incident to the University. This is the option that victims who wish
to report usually take. Furthermore, since the standard of proof is not the
same as the legal standard it is generally a more approachable option. The
University even states within its guidance on reporting sexual assault that a
decision by the Police or Crown Prosecution Service to take no further action
in relation to a criminal matter or an acquittal at a trial does not preclude
the University from taking action.</p>



<p>However, there is a significant flaw within the University’s procedure of dealing with sexual assault cases. Students who want to avoid punishment simply have to leave the University and it seems that a shockingly high number of students have been doing just that. Even more concerning is the fact that it is primarily only those students that are accused of the most serious offences which cause students to leave the University, escaping any form of punishment.</p>



<p>Specifically, in the most serious cases of Sexual Assault at Durham University, also known as “Category 2” offences, the perpetrator is referred to the Senate Discipline Committee. These offences consist of the most serious in the opinion of Durham such as rape, abusive sexual behaviour and recording without consent. However, the University has disclosed that between 2014 and December of 2018, 44% of those who referred to the Senate Discipline Committee instead withdrew from the University before the hearing could be held. In these cases, the victim will have no other outcome since the University will drop the disciplinary proceedings if the Accused Party withdraws. At the same time, the perpetrator can presumably enroll at a different university with a relatively unblemished record.</p>



<p>The University also disclosed in their report that “this is a trend that has been highlighted at conferences across the sector in the last year”. However, after The Monocle sent Freedom of Information to every Russel Group university, we can reveal that of all the Universities that responded, Durham had by far the highest rate of students leaving before the end of a university investigation.
