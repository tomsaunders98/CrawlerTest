										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Economist <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/10/18/the-strange-revival-of-vinyl-records">has
reported</a> that this year Vinyl sales are predicted to exceed those of the
CD. As one of the first concrete identifiers of the economic impact of the
hipster movement it’s fascinating to see the effect that moustachioed men in corduroy
trousers have had on our buying habits. </p>



<p>With this strange turn of events, where the development of a
subculture dedicated to ‘the aesthetic’ has resulted in the regression of
buying habits back to the 1980s, the Monocle is left wondering what other knickknacks
of yesteryear might yet make a comeback. </p>



<p>Why purchase a laptop or computer to help with your studies
when instead you could pick up a typewriter. Less convenient for sure, but some
argue that it really takes writing back to its ‘purest form’ (RIP the pen). &nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with replacing your laptop why not also replace your mobile
phone for a wired alternative that can plug into your landline at home. While
this would be infinitely less portable or adjusted for modern life, just like vinyl
records, some have argued that the sound quality makes it worth it and that ‘going
analogue’ is more reliable and secure. </p>



<p>While you’re at it why not pop by the newsagents (or Billy
B) to pick up a paper copy of your favourite (student) newspaper on your way.
Again, there’s no real reason such a thing should still exist outside of those
you get for free on the underground, but why let modern technology get in the
way of practicality by getting your news online, just like we here at the
Monocle aim to provide. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>We take a look at Man City's latest efforts to fill seats </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">It is well-known among fans of the premier league that Manchester City have been struggling to fill the Etihad since the injection of cash from owner Sheikh Mansour which marked the club’s succession to the big time. </p>



<p>This issue is especially pertinent during Champions League fixtures where thousands of empty seats can be seen across the 55,000 capacity stadium that cost £110 Million to build. </p>



<p>According to those at the top, the issue is exacerbated by playing lesser known European teams, a strange excuse that makes it sound as if an easier path through the group stages is not a desirable situation to be in. If you compare the attendance of last night’s game against Atalanta to Tottenham’s fixture against Red Star Belgrade, the London club drew in nearly 3,000 more fans. </p>



<p style="text-align:justify">The issue isn’t merely about the number of bums in seats on match day though, the atmosphere at the Etihad has been reported to be nothing like that which the club of old once provided. </p>



<p>One would think that a football team in a working class area like Manchester, who’s owner has invested net one billion pounds in the club, and millions on improving the lives of local people, would be able to get fans excited about their club winning games; whether it be against smaller teams such as Atalanta, or other top premier league clubs. </p>



<p style="text-align:justify">As a result of the reputation that the club is earning it has launched a campaign to recruit influencers who will act as ambassadors for match days in the hopes that they will draw in bigger crowds. </p>



<p>It is clear that the ownership at City are hoping their long-term tactic of buying success on the pitch will work off it by getting those with large social media followers to get more people to attend. I have a feeling, however, that even if these new influencers manage to fill  6,000 empty seats, people who actually listen to Instagram ‘celebrities’ will hardly create an atmosphere worthy of such a historic club. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">I set off from home this morning to embark on my day full of hope. Mummy drove me to the station in the old defender on her way to work, but don’t worry about that, it’s big businesses that need to change. As I sat on the train brimming with excitement for the day ahead, I bumped into none other than Tarquin and Mungo sitting with their XR banners and, of course, reusable bottles at hand (so woke) and compared carbon footprints after a summer of travelling across South America. As we got into London it was straight to ‘Itsu’ for me where I stocked up on my daily dose of single use plastic which I later ditched somewhere in St James’ Park to be choked on by a pelican. </p>



<p style="text-align:justify">When I had finally found the rest of the protestors, my brothers and sisters in arms, the buzz was palpable. We were left wondering if there was to be another surprise appearance from some B-List celebrity who had flown in from California for the occasion. Again, it’s up to big business to change their habits, not us, we’re the solution. After a good photo shoot in front of the Cenotaph and a bit of playful desecration of the war memorial the day of protesting was well on its way.  </p>



<p style="text-align:justify">Later on, we bumped into a stand handing out warm food for us hardened protestors who were in dire need of rations, I hadn’t eaten for hours and the abuse we were getting from the police was really awful. We must be the most poorly treated group of protestors in the world right now (sorry Hong Kong). On my way back to the train station I passed a group of XR activists blocking the road and wistfully thought to myself what a marvellous job they were doing, if we keep going like this the British public will be on our side in no time!  </p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Our take on the Queen's Speech. Ambitious plan or empty promises? Conor Johnson discusses this very topic. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p style="text-align:justify">…See our reigning monarch pretend that she has faith and trust in her government and prime minister, as if they didn’t lie to her about a certain prorogation of parliament just a couple of weeks ago, that is. Nonetheless, the Queen did a stand-up job at acting like someone who has genuine belief in the current crop of politicians at the top of the Tory party, reminding viewers of the best that this country has to offer. Charles at her side, on the other hand, acted as a reminder that once Queen Elizabeth is gone, so too will be her brand of expert professionalism and diplomacy. Some more discerning readers may have noticed, as every other news outlet has done, that the Queen opted for a slightly more relaxed look this afternoon, donning the state diadem, rather than the state crown, while she delivered Boris Johnson’s plans for this session of parliament. Whether this was a subtle dig at Bozza or merely a necessity for an elderly lady with a weaker neck than it once was is open for debate.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify">The speech itself touched on all manner of things that Boris and co plan on achieving in parliament, but with the majority (or lack thereof) that Boris commands it is unlikely any of these pledges will actually be achieved anytime soon, causing many to dismiss the speech as an election manifesto rather than a reasonable plan of action. In this sense it is rather uncomfortable seeing the Queen, who is obliged to attend events such as these, being used in what was effectively a glorified launch of an election campaign. </p>



<p style="text-align:justify">The first line alone
outlines what most believe to be a completely unachievable goal; to leave the
European Union on the 31<sup>st</sup> of October. If Boris could manage to convince
the other 27 member states of the EU of his nationalist plan to depart from everyone’s
favourite project of abolishing the nation state under the guise of economic
prosperity, then hats off to him. &nbsp;Meanwhile,
in the real world, Boris continues to make enemies everywhere he goes, and his
deal looks no more likely to be approved than Dominic Cummings being recruited
to stand for the Liberal Democrats. With ‘No Deal’ widely accepted to be off
the cards, in part due to the ‘Surrender/Benn Act’ (delete where appropriate)
it looks as though the main policy that Her Majesty’s government is committed
to is an unachievable one. </p>



<p style="text-align:justify">The rest of the Queen’s
speech outlines a new vision for the United Kingdom outside of the European
Union. Policies on fisheries, trade and agriculture mark the departure from the
single market and a new immigration bill to end free movement shows a commitment
to change following Britain’s (eventual) exit from the European Union. The speech
mentions everything from tougher criminal sentences for those convicted of the
most serious crimes to cameos from Carrie Symond’s own playbook such as a new
bill promising tougher sentences for animal abuse. All in all, it looks like
our prisons will be nice and busy by Christmas. </p>



<p style="text-align:justify">More progressivism can be
seen with the Environment Bill enshrining, for the first time, environmental
protection in law – that’s one for the crusties.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify">This speech then, while acting
as a list of unachievable pledges given the current parliamentary composition, is
not overly revelatory. That Boris plans on being tough on crime yet fairer on
the NHS come as no surprise after the announcements he has made in the last few
weeks. Boris told the commons that he plans on governing as a One Nation Tory,
and if he can get the Queen’s speech approved by parliament then maybe he will.
However, with that prospect looking ever unlikely we may have to wait a bit
longer before Johnson gets the chance to enact his vision on our country.</p>
