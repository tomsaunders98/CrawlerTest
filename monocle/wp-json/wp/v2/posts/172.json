He announced his much anticipated and much delayed gospel album will be released on the 25th October, but at the time of writing this there was no sign of said album as fans grow increasingly frustrated at the maverick artist.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr West informed fans on twitter that he was finishing mixing some tracks, and would \u2018not sleep till this is done\u2019, sending out serious student during summative season vibes.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The self professed \u2018greatest artist of all time\u2019 has already pushed back his album multiple times, and it has yet to be clarified if Kanye has the 25th October 2019 in mind. Some have speculated he is aiming for a 2020 release to coincide with a late run for the presidency, although unlikely he will run against his close friend Mr Trump.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kanye, a man who once walked around calling himself Yeezus, has recently undergone a religious awakening, naming his new album Jesus Is King. Some of his new found christian beliefs include abolishing the 13th amendment (which outlawed slavery), calling slavery a choice, and throwing his support behind ultra right wing president Donald trump.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has also expressed regret over any explicit language used in his previous songs, citing his regression from writing Jesus Walks to I Love It, a song where he professes his everlasting love for Hoes, no doubt to the delight of his wife and kids. West suggested that \u2018The devil was happy on that day\u2019, but it remains highly unlikely anyone enjoyed that one.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kanye likened the delay of his album to the frustration of Christians for the second coming of Christ in a recent interview with Complex. For now though, we can all put the second coming out our minds, and instead pray that Kanye drops the album sometime relatively soon.<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Will Kanye release his album tonight or not?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":173,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[8],"cc_featured_image_caption":{"caption_text":"","source_text":"Official White House Photo","source_url":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/POTD-October-11-2018.jpg"},"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/1920px-President_Donald_Trump_and_Kanye_West_2018-10-11.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&ssl=1","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 -
