Pressures such as\nhousing are largely specified, detailing the lack of first-time buyers able to\npurchase within the city due to the significantly warped housing market arising\ndue to students being charged up to six times higher rent prices than an\naverage family would pay.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around 1000 former and therefore potential family homes are being used to house the ever-growing student population, a cause for which could be the university\u2019s refusal to build on their own land, forcing over half of the students, around 64%, into neighbouring communities, continually pushing local residents further and further from the city centre. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vice Chancellor of Durham University, Professor\nCorbridge, when asked to comment on issues related to university growth by Look\nNorth, could do so little more than to emphasise the fact that through the\nuniversity, \u00a3400m is brought in every year. \n\nThough a staggering figure at a glance, when\naccommodation and tuition fees are considered, this actually leaves an almost\nnegligible amount of spending money being invested back into the local\ncommunity.&nbsp; \n\n\n\n<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Charlotte Evans discusses the University&#8217;s plans to expand and the impact this will continue to have on the local population. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":152,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[2],"tags":[12],"cc_featured_image_caption":{"caption_text":"","source_text":"","source_url":"https:\/\/pixabay.com\/photos\/street-durham-city-people-3519677\/"},"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/street-3519677_1920.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&ssl=1","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 -
