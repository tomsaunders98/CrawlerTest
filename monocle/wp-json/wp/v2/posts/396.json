What should be their role in society? Should they even have a role? Harry and Meghan are refreshingly honest in what they believe: they do not skirt around the truth, and have even allowed us to witness their human side. It is easy to see their hatred of the tabloid culture that is growing increasingly abhorrent in today\u2019s society, and their desire for privacy. They appear to have been ostracised by the royal family for their latest endeavours, losing their HRH titles. Less than affectionately called \u201cMegxit\u201d by the tabloids, the media have showered Meghan with hate and blame. But what does this tell us about the royal family today?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The public eye has been a difficult place for Meghan Markle, with the media grabbing any information they could with eager hands, and beady eyes. It has obviously also taken a toll upon Harry, a man who could not escape the media especially after the tragic death of his mother, when he was a child. The tabloids lap up any \u201cDiana\u201d references they can, but prefer to forget the trauma they subjected Harry and William. The footage of the two boys walking behind her hearse is heart-breaking, and one that symbolises the debacle, particularly as Princess Diana\u2019s car was speeding to escape the paparazzi. The personal perspective was lost in a media frenzy. So, when Harry moves toward privacy and family life, it is an understandable move. But, Meghan is inevitably blamed. As a woman new to the royal family, she is an easy target for the tabloids, and there have been a number of racist connotations toward her. They have also disrupted her private family relationships, publicly involving her father in a number of personal issues that have now been put in print.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has always been an accepted fact that the media will scrutinise our royal family. However, it is debatable whether this is scrutiny, or just abuse. Whilst this is a boundary that the media have pushed for centuries, it is becoming increasingly personal, particularly in a media culture that depends upon \u201cclicks\u201d. Harry and Meghan\u2019s latest move- to tell the tabloids they will no longer work with them- is laudable. But, simultaneously, it also seems like something that is long overdue. They should be applauded for their latest move, as it will finally give them some semblance of normal life. Harry and Meghan are not destined for Britain\u2019s throne, and if they are aggressively hounded by the media whilst living their lives in Britain, why stay?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will always be a scandal for a member of the royal family to desire privacy, and, in particular, to move abroad. It is far too a familiar scene that led to King Edward VIII\u2019s abdication in 1936. Despite this being nearly a century ago, it remains infamous for the media and the royal family. They appear desperate to retain their position and earn forgiveness for the mishap of Edward VIII, who is amazingly remembered for his abdication more than his alliance with the Nazis. The media seem to be desperate for a scandal of these proportions and will go to some lengths to try and reinvent one in a world that is far removed from it. Particularly, a world that is battling a global pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Meghan and Harry want to renounce their titles and live in peace, it should not matter. They are hardly the heirs apparent. However, the drama over it suggests that there is deep-seated insecurity of the supposed instability of the Windsor dynasty, one that is recognised by the royal family and media alike. They are desperate to have royals remain royal. Princess Anne did not allow her children, Peter Phillips, and Zara Tindall, to inherit her title, yet they remain very much in the public eye. It seems that we will never escape the obsession towards the royal family. No matter how far removed a prince may be, he is still a prince. Princes in fairy-tales always get their happy ending, but not in Britain. Here, they see their wife abused in the media, private communications leaked, pictures of his baby plastered everywhere, and constant reminders of the traumatic loss of his mother. The media needs to remember that behind every royal wave, there is a person.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lorna Cosgrave wonders what we can learn from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":10,"featured_media":398,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[],"cc_featured_image_caption":{"caption_text":"","source_text":"","source_url":""},"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/crown-312734_1280.png?fit=1280%2C706&ssl=1","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 -
