She was an undergraduate at the university, then a\nlecturer and eventually the Vice Principal of Hilde-Bede college. Three weeks after\nretiring she became a tour-guide for Durham Cathedral and 20 years later, at\nthe age of 91, she is still there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thinking\nabout her proudest moment she told me, full of modesty, \u201cI suppose it was being\nchosen as what was that called? Visit England Superstar. That was probably it.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In\nfact, in 2016 she won Durham Tourism Superstar and later in the same year the\nnational equivalent, Visit England Superstar. However, according to Lilian \u201cit\nwas the lead up to it that was amazing as anything else. One of the cannons in\nthe cathedral wrote a song which the choristers sang, and it went viral.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever\nmodest, she assured me all she had won was \u201ca hideous plaque and a huge framed\ncertificate which is sitting on the floor in my study.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I\nasked her who her favourite visitor was, she replied cautiously: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to\nsay. I\u2019ve taken Sting who told me that he wanted to adopt me as his mother.\nI\u2019ve taken Princess Anne, she was terrific fun, marvellous sense of humour.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However,\nher favourite was a local woman from Sunderland. Lilian explained that \u201cshe\ncame on a public tour and at the end of the tour she crossed my hands and said,\n\u2018flower I wouldn\u2019t have missed that for a million pounds.\u2019 And I thought that\nwas brilliant, absolutely brilliant.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Monocle talks to Durham Cathedral&#8217;s most famous tour guide.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":351,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[2],"tags":[11],"cc_featured_image_caption":{"caption_text":"","source_text":"\"Durham Cathedral\" by timrawle","source_url":"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/7811565@N03"},"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/DurhamCath.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&ssl=1","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 -
