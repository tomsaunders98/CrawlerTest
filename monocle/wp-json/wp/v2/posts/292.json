Now in its sixth year it polled 3,385 students, making it the UK\u2019s largest independent survey of its kind. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report had some dire revelations, most noticeably that\n79% of students polled worry about making ends meet \u2013 which is more students\nthan ever before. Only 38% of students said that their maintenance loans\nstretched far enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all students are able to supplement their maintenance\nloan with money from their parents or an overdraft. Furthermore, contrary to\nwhat people outside university might think, many students simply don\u2019t have\ntime to take on a part-time job in addition to their studies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This leaves students with few options in order to make ends\nmeet. This is where commercial or payday loan companies come into play. The\nsurvey noted that the popularity of payday loans has increased from 2018 to\n2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These payday loans are often exploitative, and many have\nbegun to directly target cash-strapped students. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many student unions in the UK have banned short-term lends\nfrom advertising on campus and have made active efforts to instead promote\nhardship funds instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you type \u201cStudent Loan quick\u201d into Google plenty of\nresults come up. Many advertise loans from \u00a3100-\u00a35,000 which can be agreed and\npaid in 15 minutes. One of the most prominent of these pay-day lenders is Smart\nPig which describes itself as \u201cthe only short-term loan created just for\nstudents.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart Pig is a perfect example of how an offshoot of the\nalready morally questionable pay-day loan industry deliberately attempts to influence\nvulnerable students into loans which will often lead them into more debt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the page \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.smart-pig.com\/About_Us\/Our%20Story\">Our Story<\/a>\u201d, Smart Pig mentions how the company is a student start up and that their founders \u201chave a strong ethical focus \u2026 \u00a0and really want to improve practices and reduce prices in the short-term loan industry.\u201d It is unclear exactly what Smart Pig means when it talks of its \u201cstrong ethical focus\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company has already been in trouble for advertising on\nbeer mats, on the basis that it connected payday loans with drinking. It also\nwas forced to scrap an \u2018irresponsible\u2019 poster offering a \u00a33,500 prize because\nit encouraged students to take on debt. The poster told students that \u201cEvery\ncustomer is entered into our competition to win a term\u2019s rent up to \u00a33,500.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its founders, former Goldman Sachs trader and WBFF Amateur\nFitness model Tom Parks and Shreiff Benazina, also own another short-term loan\ncompany called Buffa Loans. Buffa Loans features a picture of a mother and\nchild prominently on its landing page and advertises loans with a\nrepresentative APR of 1087%, which is more than double the 448% APR of Smart\nPig. For comparison the APR on fixed rate credit cards is around 13% and for\nvariable rate credit cards around 16%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a article in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/0ac97f30-c5cf-11e5-b3b1-7b2481276e45\">Financial Times<\/a>, Mr Benazina explained that \u201cWe don\u2019t just want to do loans,\u201d says Mr Benazina. \u201cWe want to help people find accommodation and practice for job interviews.\u201d However, at the time of saying that Mr Benazina had been a Director of Buffa Loans, for over two years and seemed to be doing exactly that. The Smart-Pig About Page makes no mention anywhere of their other payday loan ventures and clearly attempts to appear as a solely student focused venture created by good natured students when in reality, they are quite far from that. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you, or anyone you know, are facing financial difficulties or are unable to pay back a loan from a pay day lender you can contact your local <a href=\"https:\/\/www.citizensadvice.org.uk\/\">Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau<\/a> for help or take a look at <a href=\"https:\/\/debtcamel.co.uk\">DebtCamel <\/a>which has advice about payday loans and how you may be able to apply for compensation.
