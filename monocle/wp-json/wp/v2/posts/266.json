As one of the first concrete identifiers of the economic impact of the\nhipster movement it\u2019s fascinating to see the effect that moustachioed men in corduroy\ntrousers have had on our buying habits. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this strange turn of events, where the development of a\nsubculture dedicated to \u2018the aesthetic\u2019 has resulted in the regression of\nbuying habits back to the 1980s, the Monocle is left wondering what other knickknacks\nof yesteryear might yet make a comeback. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why purchase a laptop or computer to help with your studies\nwhen instead you could pick up a typewriter. Less convenient for sure, but some\nargue that it really takes writing back to its \u2018purest form\u2019 (RIP the pen). &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with replacing your laptop why not also replace your mobile\nphone for a wired alternative that can plug into your landline at home. While\nthis would be infinitely less portable or adjusted for modern life, just like vinyl\nrecords, some have argued that the sound quality makes it worth it and that \u2018going\nanalogue\u2019 is more reliable and secure. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you\u2019re at it why not pop by the newsagents (or Billy\nB) to pick up a paper copy of your favourite (student) newspaper on your way.\nAgain, there\u2019s no real reason such a thing should still exist outside of those\nyou get for free on the underground, but why let modern technology get in the\nway of practicality by getting your news online, just like we here at the\nMonocle aim to provide. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Monocle takes a look at what might be everyone&#8217;s new favourite old thing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":267,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[7],"cc_featured_image_caption":{"caption_text":"","source_text":"","source_url":""},"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/1472813049_3daee24571_h.jpg?fit=1600%2C1200&ssl=1","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Vinyl\u2019s back, what next?
