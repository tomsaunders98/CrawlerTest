If you compare the attendance of last night\u2019s game against Atalanta to Tottenham\u2019s fixture against Red Star Belgrade, the London club drew in nearly 3,000 more fans. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The issue isn\u2019t merely about the number of bums in seats on match day though, the atmosphere at the Etihad has been reported to be nothing like that which the club of old once provided. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One would think that a football team in a working class area like Manchester, who\u2019s owner has invested net one billion pounds in the club, and millions on improving the lives of local people, would be able to get fans excited about their club winning games; whether it be against smaller teams such as Atalanta, or other top premier league clubs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">As a result of the reputation that the club is earning it has launched a campaign to recruit influencers who will act as ambassadors for match days in the hopes that they will draw in bigger crowds. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is clear that the ownership at City are hoping their long-term tactic of buying success on the pitch will work off it by getting those with large social media followers to get more people to attend. I have a feeling, however, that even if these new influencers manage to fill \u00a06,000 empty seats, people who actually listen to Instagram \u2018celebrities\u2019 will hardly create an atmosphere worthy of such a historic club. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We take a look at Man City&#8217;s latest efforts to fill seats <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":156,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[4],"tags":[7],"cc_featured_image_caption":{"caption_text":"","source_text":"Sung Chi [CC BY-SA 4.0 ]","source_url":""},"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Etihad_Stadium2.jpg?fit=1350%2C759&ssl=1","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 -
