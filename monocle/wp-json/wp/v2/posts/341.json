Their Westminster leader is out, there will be a border between\nNorthern Ireland and the UK and&nbsp; for the\nfirst time there are more nationalist than loyalist MPs in Northern Ireland.\nNice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5) Brexit Party<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As entertaining as it would have been to see the polo-player\nand property millionaire Richard Tice represent the northern constituency of\nHartlepool the Brexit Party couldn\u2019t even manage that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4) Independent Tories<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Goodbye Dominic Grieve, Goodbye David Gauke, Goodbye uhhh everyone\nelse. I don\u2019t remember there being so many of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3) Heidi Allen \/ Unite for Remain<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two reasons why the Remain effort would be better off\nwithout Heidi Allen and the electoral pact between the Lib Dems, Greens and\nPlaid Cymru: Stroud and Kensington. Both constituencies could have potentially\nbeen won by Labour MPs if it wasn\u2019t for Unite to Remain splitting the vote. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no reasons why the Remain effort would be better\noff with Heidi Allen as her pact failed to win any seats at all. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2) Jeremy Corbyn \/ Labour<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>He won the argument but he couldn\u2019t convert it into a majority, which is why he will be top of my next list: 10 biggest winners in things that don\u2019t matter this election.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1)Jo Swinson \/ Lib Dems<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>She called the election. She claimed she was essential to\nstopping Brexit and that she could be the next prime minister. Ultimately, she\nsomehow ended up doing the polar opposite of both of these: unemployed and\nessential to getting Brexit done.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Monocle takes a look at this election.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":342,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[11],"cc_featured_image_caption":{"caption_text":"","source_text":"","source_url":""},"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/themonoclenow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/ballot-1294935_1280.png?fit=1257%2C1280&ssl=1","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 -
