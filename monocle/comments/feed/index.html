					<description><![CDATA[I see no flaw in the system here: the University can’t be expected to persecute people who are not associated with it, that’s the task of the police. The only way in which this could be the fault of the university would be if the accused party were able to finish their degree and leave with no consequence, on account of the insufficient frequency of Senate Discipline Committee meetings. The article does not imply that this is the case, but rather that the accused party chooses to leave the university before a decision is made, which, while perhaps not punishment enough, ends what the university can do. It is unclear what the article implies would be an improvement, publishing the personal information of accused parties who left before comittee meeting? Perhaps automatically handing the matter over to the police, with the victims consent is the only option. The data concerning accused parties dropping out of other Russel Group universities does not suggest much, it could perhaps be interpreted as proof of Durham’s serious treatment of matters of sexual misconduct, since an accused party fears expulsion more than in other universities and so chooses to drop out as a precaution.]]></description>
