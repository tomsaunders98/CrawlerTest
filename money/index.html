  <div class="title"> What happened to US Treasuries in March? <span class="subtitle">By Thomas Saunders</span></div>
  <div class="desc">
    <p>On <span class="red">February 28<sup>th</sup></span>, the stock market suffered the single biggest decline since the 2008 financial crisis. Investors rushed to buy US Treasuries, loans issued by the US government, long considered the world’s
      safe-haven asset. As demand for Treasuries increased, the price of those bonds increased (and so their yield fell). Everything was working as it should.
    </p>
    <p>This graph shows the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, which is of particular importance to the economy because it is used as a benchmark across the economy and influences everything from mortgage rates to auto loans.</p>


  </div>
  <div class="desc">
    <p>However, on the week beginning 20<sup>th</sup> March the yields rose sharply. What seems like a small<span class="red"> blip</span> was really a very serious irregularity in the most important financial market in the world.</p>
    <p>Rumours abounded of hedge funds imploding under the weight of disastrous Treasury bets. There was even the faint prospect that there may be a failed auction on US government debt, meaning the U.S. government wouldn't be able to fund itself.
    </p>
    <p> So what happened ?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="desc">
    <p>The number of transactions in the primary<sup>1</sup> Treasury market increased during the first weeks of the crisis, mirroring the fall in interest rates.</p>
    <p>Yet at the same time interest rates began to rise, the number of transactions fell steeply.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="desc">
    <p>The market came to a shuddering stop thanks to particular hedge funds that invested heavily in a strategy called a “basis trade”. The idea behind the strategy is that hedge funds can take advantage of miniscule differences between the price of
      a Treasury and its stipulated future price<sup>2</sup>. The differences between the two are often so small that hedge funds borrow cash to increase their returns.
    </p>
    <p>But in March, huge numbers of investors fled to the Treasury market which ruined the strategy and many hedge funds found themselves out of pocket and heavily in debit. As they tried to recoup their costs, the Hedge funds sold immense numbers
      of US Treasuries for cash.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="desc">
    <p>This wave of selling can be seen in the number of foreign holders of US Treasuries, which most hedge funds are for tax reasons, who sold to US residents (typically US banks). Not only was it the highest on record but it was an extreme outlier,
      far exceeding any anything seen during the Great Recession in 2009. </p>
    <p> Hedge funds offloaded so many of these treasuries that it simply overwhelmed the major US banks who would typically buy these securities in order to keep the market functioning and liquid. New regulations after the Great Recession limited the
      amount of Treasuries that these banks could buy. Suddenly, the treasury market began to break down. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="desc">
    <p>In order to avoid a total economic meltdown the Fed stepped in and pledged to purchase at least $500bn in US Treasuries. When this wasn’t enough, the Fed instead said that it would purchase as many Treasuries as necessary to restore liquidity
      to the market.
    </p>
    <p>As the <span style="color:#C85E2F;">Federal Reserves balance sheet</span> spiralled upwards, liquidity was restored and the treasury yields, along with the market as a whole, began to stabilise.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="desc">
    <p>Even though the immediate danger of economic catastrophe was avoided, those heady days of March and April led many Hedge funds to abandon their “basis trade” strategy altogether. </p>
    <p> This has caused its own problems for the Treasury markets. The markets for Treasury Futures<sup>2</sup> and off-the-run treasuries, which are older bonds that trade far less frequently than the recently issued “on-the-run” treasuries, have
      become far quieter in recent months.
    </p>
    <p>Less basis trading also means less demand for treasuries overall. Turnover on CME’s BrokerTec, the biggest platform for electronic trading of Treasuries, has fallen around 38%. Less demand for Treasuries mean their interest rates are rising,
      which increases the cost of borrowing across the entire economy. </p>
    <p>
      At the very least, an economic meltdown of inconceivable proportions was avoided but questions remain about just how safe, and deep, the Treasury market really is.

      <h3> The Data </h3>
      <ol>
        <li> Data on 10-year Treasury Yields from <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WGS10YR">Federal Reserve Bank of ST. Louis. </a></li>
        <li> Primary Dealer transactions was used as a proxy for the secondary market since that data has only been freely available since March. The data is taken from <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/primarydealers">Federal Reserve Bank
            of New York</a></li>
        <li> Data on Number of transactions by foreigners to US nationals from the <a href="https://ticdata.treasury.gov/Publish/s1_99996.txt"> Treasury International Capital System</a></li>
        <li> Data on Federal Reserve's Assets from <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/H41/default.htm">Fed H.4.1 Balance Sheet</a></li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <h3> Notes </h3>
      <ol>
        <li> Primary dealers are banks or other financial institutions that have been approved to trade securities with a national government. They act as the "market makers" who then sell the Treasuries on to their clients, creating the secondary
          market.</li>
        <li> Futures are a derivative financial contract that obligates the buyer and seller of an asset to exchange the asset at a predetermined price and date. Treasury futures are sold by CME Group Inc. </li>
      </ol>

      <h3> Credits </h3>
      <p> To write this piece I relied on two papers. Firstly, a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/still-the-worlds-safe-haven/"> report</a> by Darrel Duffe for Brookings and also the <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/bisbull02.pdf"> BIS
          Bulletin no 2</a> by Andreas Schrimpf, Hyun Song Shin and Vladyslav Sushko. This was especially helpful in elaborating how the "basis trade" operates.
